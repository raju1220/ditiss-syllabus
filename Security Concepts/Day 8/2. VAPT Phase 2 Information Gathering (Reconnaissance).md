### **Passive Information Gathering**

- **Definition:**
    
    - Indirect method of gathering information about a target.
    - No direct connection exists between the attacker and the target.
- **Example:**
    
    - Asking third parties about the target.

### **Active Information Gathering**

- **Definition:**
    
    - Directly interacting with the target to gather information.
    - Creates a direct connection between the attacker and the target.
- **Example:**
    
    - Directly questioning or probing the target.

## **Objective of Information Gathering**

- Understand the targetâ€™s infrastructure:
    - **Number of PCs.**
    - **Number and types of servers (e.g., database, Linux, Windows).**
    - **Overall network layout.**

## **Passive Information Gathering (Footprinting)**

### **Definition:**

- Collecting information without directly interacting with the target.
- Uses open-source tools and publicly available data.

### **Techniques:**

1. **Open Web Information Gathering**
    
    - Use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and techniques.
2. **Google Hacking (Google Dorks):**
    
    - Search for specific data using advanced search operators in Google.
    - Developed by Johnny Long (Hackers for Charity, Twitter: **@ihackstuff**).
    
    **Examples of Google Dorks:**
    
    - `filetype:pdf something`
        
    - `filetype:sql something`
        
    - `intext:gmail.com intext:password something`
        
    - Explore Google Hacking Database on [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database).
        
3. **Hosting Types:**
    
    - **Shared Hosting:** Multiple users share the same server.
    - **Dedicated Hosting:** Exclusive server for one user or organization.
4. **IP and Domain Lookup:**
    
    - **IP Lookup:**
        
        - Example: Searching for vehicle-related details in RTO databases, such as:
            - Vehicle type, color, owner, registration, challan, contact info, address.
    - **Whois Lookup (ICANN):**
        
        - Determine the owner of a domain.
        - Find contact information and address.
        - For Linux:
            ```bash
            whois <domain_name>
            which whois  # Checks if `whois` is installed.
            sudo apt install whois  # Install `whois` if not available.
            ```
5. **Shodan:**
    
    - A specialized search engine for finding information about hosts and connected devices on the internet.
    - Extremely useful for identifying public-facing infrastructure.
