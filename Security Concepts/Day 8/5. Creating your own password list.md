### **Creating Your Own Password List with Crunch**

1. **Setup:**
    
    ```bash
    mkdir hackwifi
    cd hackwifi
    mkdir mylist
    cd mylist
    vim char.txt
    ```
    
    - In `char.txt`, write the characters you want to include in the passwords (e.g., `1234567890`).
2. **Generate the Password List:**
    
    ```bash
    crunch 3 3 -f char.txt -o mylist.txt
    ```
    
    - **What it does:**
        - `3 3`: Minimum and maximum password length is 3 characters.
        - `char.txt`: File containing characters for password generation.
        - `mylist.txt`: Output file where passwords are stored.
3. **Alternative Command:**
    
    - Skip the `char.txt` file and specify characters directly:
        
        ```bash
        crunch 3 3 0123456789 -o mylist.txt
        ```
        
4. **Additional Tips:**
    
    - Crunch will show the **estimated size** of the file while generating passwords.
    - You can include special characters, letters, or any other known hints in `char.txt` or directly in the command:
        
        ```bash
        crunch 3 3 @#$123ABC -o mylist.txt
        ```
        
        - Example: If the password contains letters, numbers, and special characters, Crunch will combine all possibilities.
