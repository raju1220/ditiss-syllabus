### **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

- **What is it?**
    
    - DAST tests live web applications dynamically by simulating attacks on them.
    - It focuses on finding runtime vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, etc., in live environments.
- **Example Tool**: **ZAP (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy)**
    
    - **Commands for Kali Linux**:
        
        ```bash
        which zap
        sudo apt install zaproxy
        sudo zaproxy
        ```
        
        - Select **No** when asked to persist the session.
        - Update everything if time permits.
        - For Firefox users: Copy the URL from the browser and paste it in the **Automated Scan Panel**.
        - Use the **Traditional Spider** option and keep it active.
        - Press **Attack** to start the scan.
        - Vulnerabilities will be listed after the scan, along with a **Risk vs. Confidence Chart**.
        - Generate a **ZAP Scanning Report** after completing the scan.
    
    ⚠️ **Important**: Perform scans only on websites where you have explicit permission to do so. Logs can be used against you otherwise.
    
- **Burp Suite (Professional Version)**:
    
    - Steps:
        1. Open Burp Suite and select **New Scan**.
        2. Choose **Crawl and Audit**.
        3. Enter the website URL.
        4. Choose the scan type: **Lightweight, Fast, Balanced, or Deep**.
        5. Press **Scan** to begin.

### **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**

- **What is it?**
    - SAST analyzes application source code or binaries to detect vulnerabilities.
    - It's used during the **development phase** to catch issues early before deployment.

### **Comparison of SAST and DAST**

|Feature|**SAST**|**DAST**|
|---|---|---|
|**Phase**|Development phase.|Post-deployment or in live environments.|
|**Analysis**|Static (source code or binaries).|Dynamic (running applications).|
|**Type of Vulnerability**|Detects logic or design flaws.|Detects runtime vulnerabilities.|
|**Tools**|SonarQube, Checkmarx.|ZAP, Burp Suite.|
