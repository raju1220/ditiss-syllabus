### **MVC Structure (Model-View-Controller)**

- **MVC** is a software design pattern used for developing user interfaces.
    - **Model**: Manages the data and logic of the application.
    - **View**: Displays the data (UI).
    - **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model or view as needed.
- This structure promotes separation of concerns, making the application easier to maintain, test, and scale.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase**                 | During development (static code analysis). | After deployment (dynamic application testing). |
| **Scope**                 | Analyzes source code or binaries.          | Tests running applications for vulnerabilities. |
| **Type of Vulnerability** | Logic flaws, bugs in the code.             | Runtime vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, etc.    |
| **Example Tools**         | SonarQube, Checkmarx.                      | ZAP, Burp Suite.                                |
