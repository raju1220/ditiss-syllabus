### **Server**

- A **server** is a device that provides services to clients based on a request-response model.
- Example: When you enable a mobile hotspot and connect your laptop to access the internet, your mobile acts as a server.
- **Common misconceptions about servers**:
    - Servers are not always high-performance devices with large storage or computational power.
    - Even a small device can be a server if it provides a service.
    - Sometimes, a client device might have better specifications than the server.

### **Website Hosting Requirements**

**Example**: Hosting a website like _helloditiss.com_

1. **Domain Name Registration**:
    
    - A domain name (e.g., _helloditiss.com_) is registered through organizations like **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
    - Without a domain name, users must remember the website's IP address to access it.
    - **A Record**: Used in DNS (Domain Name System) for forward lookup, mapping the domain name to the IP address of the web server.
2. **Public Static IP Address**:
    
    - Required for the website to be accessible globally.
    - **Why static?**
        - If the IP changes, the DNS A record must be updated every time, causing inconvenience.
