1. **Internal Network**
    
    - Virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with each other if they are on the same internal network, but cannot access the internet or the host machine.
2. **Bridged**
    
    - The host and VMs share the same network, with the host providing IP addresses via DHCP. VMs can access the internet if the host can.
3. **Host-Only**
    
    - VMs can only communicate with the host machine, but cannot access the internet. The host can access the internet.
4. **NAT**
    
    - VMs are assigned private IP addresses by the host. VMs can ping the host, but the host cannot ping the VMs.
5. **NAT Network**
    
    - Similar to NAT, but VMs within the network cannot communicate with each other.
