### **Vulnerability**

A weakness in a system, application, or network that can be exploited by attackers.  
**Examples**: Software bugs, misconfigurations.  
**Types**: Issues in design or code that attackers can exploit to gain access to the system.

### **Web Application: DVWA**

**Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**

- **Open Source**
- **Developed in PHP**
- Used for practicing penetration testing.

#### **Setting up DVWA in Kali Linux**

1. Use **Bridge Mode** (IP: 192.168.100.x)
2. Accessible from Windows machine
3. Automatically runs on **port 42001**

### **OWASP Top 10**

The **OWASP Top 10** is a list of the most critical security risks in web applications.

- Its goal is to help developers build secure applications by avoiding these vulnerabilities.
- **Note**: While following OWASP guidelines helps, it doesnâ€™t guarantee full security, as hackers continuously find new ways to exploit systems.
- **Importance**: Companies hiring for security roles typically expect knowledge of the OWASP Top 10.

### **Brute Force Attack**

A brute force attack involves trying all possible combinations to guess a password.  
**Example**:

- **Numbers**: 0-9 (10 possibilities)
- **Alphabets**: a-z (26) + A-Z (26) = 52 possibilities
- **Special Characters**: 10 possibilities

#### **Password Strength Calculation**

- **1 character** password: 70^1 (70 attempts)
- **2 character** password: 70^2 (4,900 attempts)
- **3 character** password: 70^3 (343,000 attempts)
- For a password with 8 characters, the number of attempts would be around **70^8**, which is **practically impossible** to break using brute force.

#### **Prevention**

- Increase password complexity (e.g., use a mix of characters, numbers, symbols).

### **Dictionary Attack**

A dictionary attack tries a list of common passwords instead of all combinations.  
Common types of passwords targeted in dictionary attacks include:

- **Same digits**: 000, 111, 222, etc.
- **Sequential digits**: 123, 234, 345, etc.
- **Reversed sequences**: 098, 987, 876, etc.

These common password lists are widely available on the internet.

### **Burp Suite**

**Burp Suite** is a **man-in-the-middle** tool used to intercept, analyze, and manipulate traffic between the client and server.

- Used for penetration testing and traffic analysis.
- **Automated Brute Force Attack**: Burp Suite can be used to automate brute force attacks.
