**Steps to Bypass OTP:**

1. **Turn off Burp Suite Interceptor** and open your browser.
2. **Search for "Xplore" on Google** (or any site with an OTP vulnerability).
3. **Click the "Register" button** to begin the OTP verification process.
4. **Turn on the Burp Suite Interceptor** after clicking the register button.
5. **Enter your phone number** and click **"Send OTP"**.
    - At this stage, the OTP request might not show in Burp Suite, meaning the verification is happening **on the page itself**.
6. **Inspect the page** by right-clicking and selecting **"Inspect"**.
7. **Search for the "Verify" button's code** in the page’s source code.
    - You can find the OTP from this code.

### **Explanation**

- In this method, we bypass the OTP check because of **vulnerabilities in the source code** written by developers.
- The OTP process is supposed to be handled on the server side, but here, it’s being handled on the client-side (in the page’s code), making it easier for attackers to retrieve or bypass the OTP.
