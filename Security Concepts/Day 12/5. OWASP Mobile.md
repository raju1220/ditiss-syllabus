### **OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks**

1. **M1: Improper Credential Usage**
    
    - **Description:** Weaknesses in how credentials are managed or used, leading to poor authentication and authorization practices. This includes weak password policies, poor token management, and improper use of session management.
    - **Examples:** Hardcoded passwords, credentials stored insecurely, or the reuse of passwords across multiple platforms.
2. **M2: Inadequate Supply Chain Security**
    
    - **Description:** Risks arising from third-party libraries, SDKs, or frameworks used in mobile applications. Malicious code or vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited.
    - **Examples:** Including insecure or outdated libraries, dependency on untrusted third-party code, and lack of monitoring over third-party components.
3. **M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization**
    
    - **Description:** Weak or broken mechanisms for authenticating users and controlling access to sensitive data or functionality. This can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
    - **Examples:** Insecure storage of authentication tokens, improper session handling, and lack of strong authentication mechanisms.
4. **M4: Insufficient Input/Output Validation**
    
    - **Description:** Failure to properly validate user input or sanitize output, which can lead to vulnerabilities like code injection or buffer overflows.
    - **Examples:** SQL injection, XML injection, improper validation of user input fields, and failure to properly encode output.
5. **M5: Insecure Communication**
    
    - **Description:** Insecure transmission of sensitive data over unprotected networks. This includes the use of insecure protocols and failure to use encryption where required.
    - **Examples:** Data sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS, failure to validate SSL/TLS certificates, and improper handling of session tokens during communication.
6. **M6: Inadequate Privacy Controls**
    
    - **Description:** Weak controls over personal data that can lead to privacy violations. This includes improper collection, storage, or sharing of sensitive information.
    - **Examples:** Collecting unnecessary data, poor consent management, and inadequate protection of user privacy settings.
7. **M7: Insufficient Binary Protections**
    
    - **Description:** Weaknesses in protecting the app’s code and binary files, making it easier for attackers to reverse-engineer the app and extract sensitive information or exploit vulnerabilities.
    - **Examples:** Lack of code obfuscation, poor binary protection mechanisms, and the use of insecure libraries or third-party code that can be exploited.
8. **M8: Security Misconfiguration**
    
    - **Description:** Misconfigurations in the app’s settings or the underlying infrastructure that lead to security vulnerabilities.
    - **Examples:** Default settings that are insecure, open ports, unnecessary services running, and misconfigured APIs.
9. **M9: Insecure Data Storage**
    
    - **Description:** Storing sensitive information insecurely, which can be accessed by attackers if the device is compromised or if the data is improperly handled.
    - **Examples:** Storing unencrypted passwords, personal information, or session tokens in the app’s local storage or in the cloud.
10. **M10: Insufficient Cryptography**
    
    - **Description:** The failure to properly encrypt sensitive data or the use of weak cryptographic algorithms that can be easily broken.
    - **Examples:** Using outdated cryptographic standards (e.g., MD5 or SHA1), weak key management, or improper use of encryption libraries.
