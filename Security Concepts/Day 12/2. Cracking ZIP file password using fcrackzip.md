#### **1. Prepare Your Environment**

1. **Install `fcrackzip`:**
    
    - `fcrackzip` is pre-installed on most Kali Linux distributions. If not, install it:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install fcrackzip
        ```
        
2. **Create a Password-Protected ZIP File (Optional):**
    
    - If you want to test on your own ZIP file:
        
        ```bash
        zip -e test.zip testfile.txt
        ```
        
    - You will be prompted to set a password for the ZIP file.

#### **2. Locate or Create a Wordlist**

- **Use an Existing Wordlist:**
    
    - Kali Linux includes popular wordlists, like `rockyou.txt`:
        
        ```bash
        /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
        ```
        
        If itâ€™s compressed, decompress it:
        
        ```bash
        gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
        ```
        
- **Create a Custom Wordlist (Optional):**
    
    - Generate a small wordlist for testing:
        
        ```bash
        crunch 4 4 0123456789 -o custom_wordlist.txt
        ```
        

---

#### **3. Brute Force Attack on ZIP File**

1. Run `fcrackzip` with the wordlist:
    
    ```bash
    fcrackzip -u -D -p /path/to/wordlist.txt /path/to/zipfile.zip
    ```
    
    - **`-u`**: Test unzipping the file to verify the password.
    - **`-D`**: Use a dictionary attack.
    - **`-p`**: Specify the path to the wordlist.
2. Example Command:
    
    ```bash
    fcrackzip -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt test.zip
    ```

_You can use `-v` (verbose) if you want to see what is going on in the background_

#### **4. Analyze the Results**

- If the password is cracked, it will appear in the output:
    
    ```
    PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == <password>
    ```

### **Tips:**

1. **Optimize Wordlists:** Use relevant wordlists based on the target ZIP file.
2. **Understand ZIP Encryption:** `fcrackzip` works on files encrypted with legacy ZIP algorithms. It may not work on modern ZIP formats (e.g., AES-encrypted ZIPs).
3. **Testing Environment:** Always use these techniques on files you own or have explicit permission to test.
