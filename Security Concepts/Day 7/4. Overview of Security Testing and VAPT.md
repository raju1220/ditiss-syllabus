#### **1. Black Box Testing**

- **Definition:** Testing with **zero knowledge** of the target system.
- **Purpose:**
    - Simulates an **external attacker's perspective**.
    - Evaluates what an outsider or competitor could do without insider information.

#### **2. White Box Testing**

- **Definition:** Testing with **complete information** provided about the target system.
- **Purpose:**
    - Simulates the perspective of **insiders**, such as employees.
    - Identifies potential damages caused by malicious or negligent insiders.

#### **3. Grey Box Testing**

- **Definition:** Testing with **partial information** provided.
- **Scenario:**
    - Example: An employee who left the company years ago retains some outdated information.
- **Purpose:**
    - Simulates an **insider with limited access** or a partially informed attacker.
    - Identifies potential risks from semi-knowledgeable threats.

### **Key Elements for Effective Security Testing**

Before conducting security testing, ensure the balance of the following three elements:

#### **1. People**

- **Red Team:**
    - Simulates attackers, identifying vulnerabilities from an outsider's perspective.
- **Blue Team:**
    - Defenders responsible for managing and maintaining security.
- **White Team:**
    - Resolves conflicts between Red and Blue Teams (e.g., whether an issue is a feature or vulnerability).

#### **2. Process**

- **Analogy:** Just as you follow steps to cook Paneer Mutter Masala, security testing relies on predefined methodologies.
- **Common Methodology:**
    - **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual):**
        - Provides a structured approach to performing penetration testing and security assessments.
    - **Internal Methodologies:**
        - Custom processes defined by organizations for consistency in testing.

#### **3. Technology**

- Includes the tools and platforms used in security testing.
    - **Client Applications:** Applications being tested.
    - **Testing Technologies:** Tools used for scanning, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.

### **Balancing People, Process, and Technology**

- A balanced combination of all three elements is critical for comprehensive and effective security testing.

### **Phases of VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)**

**1. Planning**

- Define objectives, scope, and approach for the testing.

**2. Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)**

- Collect data about the target system using open-source and internal tools.

**3. Vulnerability Assessment**

- Identify weaknesses in the system without attempting to exploit them.

**4. Penetration Testing**

- Simulate real-world attacks in a controlled environment to exploit vulnerabilities.

> **Note:** If the scope includes only Vulnerability Assessment (VA), **Penetration Testing (PT)** is not performed.

**5. Reporting**

- Document findings, risks, and recommendations for remediation.
- We have to report about the tests performed above as well.

	Tools for Reporting: TreePad is one of such application where you can create the VAPT report. You can even insert screenshots and hyperlinks inside a report using Treepad.
