- **Ping Behavior:**
    
    - The **Base Machine** cannot ping the VMs, as it is not part of the internal network.
    - **VM1 and VM2 can ping each other**, as they are part of the same internal network.
- **Internet Access:**
    
    - The **Base Machine** retains its own internet access.
    - **VM1 and VM2 do not have internet access** unless additional routing (e.g., NAT) or bridging is configured.
