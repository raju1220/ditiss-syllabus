The **NAT Network** configuration differs from basic **NAT** mode by allowing VMs to communicate with each other within the virtual NAT network while still providing internet access via the host.

1. **Ping Behavior in NAT Network Mode:**
    - The **Base Machine** (host) does **not directly communicate** with the VMs because the NAT network is isolated.
    - **VM1 and VM2 can ping each other** because they share the same NAT network.
2. **Internet Access:**
    - All VMs have internet access through the NAT network.
    - The Base Machine naturally has its own internet access.
