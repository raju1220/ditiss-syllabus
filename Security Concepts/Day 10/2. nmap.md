### How to Learn About Any Tool:

2. **Explore online documentation** (official websites, forums, etc.)
3. **Use cheat sheets** (available online for quick reference)

### Common Nmap Commands:

1. **Scan a single target with detailed information:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
    
    - `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
    - `-T4`: Optimizes speed for scanning (use `-T5` for faster but riskier scans).
2. **Scan an entire network (including all devices in the range):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo nmap -A -T4 <target_network_with_netmask>
    ```
    
    - This will scan all devices within the specified network range.

### Important Note:

- **Do not run Nmap scans on websites or networks you do not have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized scanning may be illegal and result in penalties.
