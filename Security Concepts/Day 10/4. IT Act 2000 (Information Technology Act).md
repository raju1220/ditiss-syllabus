### **Shreya Singhal vs Union of India (2015)**

This landmark case involved the **Section 66A** of the IT Act (which was later struck down) that criminalized sending offensive messages through communication services, social media, or websites.

- **Background**: The case was filed by Shreya Singhal, who challenged the constitutionality of Section 66A, which allowed the police to arrest individuals for posting content online that was considered offensive, obscene, or annoying. The section was criticized for being **vague** and **overbroad**, leading to the potential for **misuse** and **violation of free speech**.
- **Judgment**: In **2015**, the Supreme Court of India struck down **Section 66A** of the IT Act, declaring it **unconstitutional**. The court ruled that the law was too broad and violated the **Right to Freedom of Speech** under **Article 19(1)(a)** of the Constitution. The judgment marked a major victory for internet freedom and curbed arbitrary arrests for online speech.

### Conclusion

The **IT Act 2000**, especially with its **2008 amendments**, plays a crucial role in addressing the legal aspects of the digital world in India. The Shreya Singhal case is particularly important as it clarified the limits of free speech online and led to the repeal of a controversial provision.
