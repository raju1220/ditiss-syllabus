Threat risk modeling is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential security threats to systems or applications. Here's a concise overview:

1. **Understanding the Risks**: Identify assets, potential threats, vulnerabilities, and threat agents to understand what needs protection and from whom.
    
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified threats exploiting vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on their potential effect on the organization.
    
3. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Develop and implement measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of threats, such as security controls, policies, and procedures.
    
4. **Mitigating Risks Using the STRIDE Model**: Developed by Microsoft, the STRIDE model categorizes threats into six types:
    
    - **Spoofing**: Impersonating identities.
    - **Tampering**: Altering data.
    - **Repudiation**: Denying actions.
    - **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information.
    - **Denial of Service**: Disrupting services.
    - **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized access.
    
    By mapping threats to these categories, organizations can systematically identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**: While the STRIDE model is a widely used methodology for threat modeling, other models like PASTA, CVSS, Trike, and Attack Trees offer different frameworks to identify, analyze, and prioritize threats. Selecting an appropriate model depends on the organization's specific needs and context.
