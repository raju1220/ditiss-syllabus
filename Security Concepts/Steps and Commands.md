### Session Hijacking

#### Prerequisites:

- The username is `mittu` and the password is `letmein`.
- You will need Burp Suite installed and running as your proxy.

1. **Set up Burp Suite:**
- Open Burp Suite and start the "Proxy" tab.
- Ensure your browser is configured to use Burp Suite’s proxy (default is `127.0.0.1:8080`).

2. **Login to the Target Website:**
- Open your browser and go to the login page (e.g., `paul.nasawebtech.com`).
- Enter the username (`mittu`) and password (`letmein`), then click "Login."
- The login request will be captured by Burp Suite in the "Proxy" tab.

3. **Intercept the Request:**
- In Burp Suite, ensure that the "Intercept" button in the "Proxy" tab is turned on.
- When you click "Login," the request will be intercepted by Burp Suite.

4. **Forward the Request (Login):**
- Once the login request is intercepted, forward it by clicking the "Forward" button in Burp Suite to send the request to the target server.
- The server will authenticate the request, and a session cookie will be generated for the user `mittu`.

5. **Capture the Session Cookie:**

- Once the login request is forwarded, go to the "HTTP History" tab in Burp Suite under the "Proxy" section.
- Look for the login request and find the `Set-Cookie` header in the response. This will contain the session cookie for the user `mittu`.
    - Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionid=abc123xyz456; Path=/; HttpOnly`
- Copy the session ID (e.g., `abc123xyz456`).

6. **Use the Session Cookie for Hijacking:**
- Now, you will impersonate the logged-in session using the copied session cookie.
- In Burp Suite, go to the "Intercept" tab and turn off interception if it is on (so that it won't capture new requests).
- Open the "Intruder" tab in Burp Suite and configure a new attack.
- In the "Intruder" tab, go to the "Positions" tab and add the session cookie in the request headers, where the session cookie needs to be placed (e.g., `Cookie: sessionid=abc123xyz456`).

7. **Access the Hijacked Session:**
- Send a request to a restricted page on the website that requires authentication (e.g., a user dashboard page).
- In your browser, manually insert the copied session cookie as part of the request header, or use Burp Suite to inject it.
- Example:
    - In your browser’s developer tools (Network tab), look for a request to the website. Edit the `Cookie` header to include the hijacked session cookie value (`sessionid=abc123xyz456`).

8. **Verify Session Hijacking:**
- If the session hijacking is successful, you should have access to the user’s session (e.g., the `mittu` user’s account).
- This will allow you to perform actions as the authenticated user without knowing their password.

## **Password Sniffing using Wireshark**

1. **Install and Launch Wireshark:**
- Download and install Wireshark from the official website: [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Once installed, open Wireshark

2. **Select the Network Interface:**
- In Wireshark, choose the network interface that you will use to capture packets. This is typically your active network connection (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- Click on the interface you want to use (e.g., `Wi-Fi` or `eth0`).

3. **Start Packet Capturing:**
- After selecting the network interface, click the **Start** button to begin capturing network packets.
- Wireshark will now capture all the network traffic on the selected interface.

4. **Access the Target Website:**
- Open your web browser and go to the login page of the website (e.g., `paul.nasawebtech.com`).
- Enter the username (`mittu`) and password (`letmein`), then submit the form.

5. **Filter HTTP Traffic in Wireshark:**
- Once you submit the login form, Wireshark will capture the network packets related to the HTTP request.
- To filter for HTTP traffic (which includes login information), use the Wireshark filter:
    
    ```
    ip.addr == 168.235.71.55 && http
    ```
    
- This filter will show only the packets related to HTTP communication, which includes web requests and responses. These packets will be associated with `paul.nasawebtech.com` only since we have filtered the `ip` as well.

6. **Look for the Login Request:**
- Find the HTTP POST request that was made when you submitted the login form. It will typically contain the login data, including the username and password.
- Right-click on a packet and choose **Follow** -> **HTTP Form URL included** to view the full HTTP request.
- The username (`mittu`) and password (`letmein`) will be visible in the HTTP request, depending on whether the website is using **HTTP** (not HTTPS).
