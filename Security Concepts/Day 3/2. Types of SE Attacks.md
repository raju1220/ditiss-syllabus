### **Human-Based Social Engineering Attacks**

1. **Eavesdropping**
    
    - The attacker listens in on conversations where employees discuss **confidential company or project information**.
    - By overhearing these conversations, the attacker gathers details about the company, employees, and projects.
2. **Shoulder Surfing**
    
    - Attackers watch as someone enters confidential information, like passwords or ATM PINs.
    - Common locations: ATMs, shopping malls, or stores where people use debit/credit cards or UPI.
    - They observe the PINs being entered to use them later.
3. **Dumpster Diving**
    
    - Attackers search through **discarded items**, such as ATM transaction receipts, to find valuable information.
    - Example: Using the receipt to see the victim’s remaining balance and masking part of the account number, they may attempt reverse social engineering to get more details.
4. **Reverse Social Engineering**
    
    - The attacker pretends to be someone trustworthy, like a **bank official**, and uses partial information to extract more details.
    - Example: After finding an ATM receipt, they might call the victim and say, “We need your account number for verification,” while sharing the remaining balance to appear legitimate.
5. **Piggybacking**
    
    - Used to bypass **physical security** in an organization.
    - The attacker may create a **fake ID card** to gain entry or trick security into believing they are authorized.
6. **Tailgating**
    
    - The attacker follows an **authorized person** into a secure area right after they use their ID card.
    - Relies on the authorized individual not questioning their presence.

### **Computer-Based Social Engineering Attacks**

1. **Phishing**
    
    - **Definition**: Pronounced as _"fishing"_, it’s a scam designed to steal sensitive information such as:
        - Credit card details
        - Social Security Numbers
        - User IDs and passwords
    - **Also Known As**: Brand Spoofing
    - **How It Works**:
        - Attackers send official-looking emails pretending to be from legitimate organizations (e.g., ISPs, retail stores).
    - **Prevention**:
        - Never click on suspicious links if you suspect a phishing attack.
2. **Publishing Malicious Apps**
    
    - Attackers create and publish apps that appear useful but are designed to **steal your data**.
    - Example: Apps offering **free access** to premium services like Netflix or Amazon Prime often contain malicious code.
3. **Repacking Legitimate Apps**
    
    - Legitimate apps are **repackaged** with **malicious code** and made available on torrents or non-legitimate websites.
    - These apps may look identical to the original but can compromise your sensitive information by including additional harmful content.
4. **Fake Security Apps**
    
    - Attackers use pop-ups to claim that your device is **not secure** and prompt you to download a security app or antivirus.
    - These apps are often **viruses** themselves and should never be downloaded.
5. **Using SMS**
    
    - Attackers send SMS messages containing malicious links or requests for sensitive information.
    - These messages often appear to come from trusted sources to trick the victim.
