
1. **Default Users**:
    
    - Windows: **Administrator**
    - Linux: **root**
2. **Security Accounts Manager (SAM)**:
    
    - A database in Windows that stores usernames, passwords, and group information.
    - Stored in `C:/Windows/system32/config/SAM`.
    - By default, SAM is locked and cannot be accessed even by the Administrator.
    - Passwords are stored in hash format.
3. **Password Policies**:
    
    - "User must change password at next logon" – Forces password change on first login.
    - "Password never expires" – Useful for third-party software accounts where the password should not expire.
4. **Commands**:
    
    - `net /? /?` → For help.
    - `net user <username> * /add` → Add a new user.

### **Workgroup vs. Domain**

1. **Workgroup** (Small Companies):
    
    - Each computer has its own security database (SAM).
    - Users can only log into the computer where they are created.
    - Suitable for small-scale environments.
2. **Domain** (Large Companies):
    
    - A centralized security database is used, called **Active Directory**.
    - Domain allows centralized management of users and resources.
    - Domain names follow the format of internet domains (e.g., `sunbeam.com`).
