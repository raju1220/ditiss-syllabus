
1. **Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)**:
    
    - Centralizes the security database for user and resource management.
2. **Domain Controller (DC)**:
    
    - The server responsible for managing the domainâ€™s security database.
3. **Additional Domain Controller (ADC)**:
    
    - Acts as a backup for the DC.
    - Helps balance the load and provides redundancy.
4. **Domain Tree**:
    
    - A collection of domains with a parent-child relationship (e.g., `cdac.com`, `param.cdac.com`).
5. **Forest**:
    
    - A collection of domain trees.
    - Domains within a forest communicate with a 2-way trust.

### **Domain Controller (DC)**

- **Definition**: A DC is a server that creates and manages all security aspects of a domain, including user authentication and access to resources.
- **Functions**:
    - Stores the Active Directory database, which contains information about users, groups, and devices.
    - Handles login requests and grants permissions based on the security policies of the domain.
- **Role**: Essential for maintaining the security and organization of a network in larger environments.

### **Additional Domain Controller (ADC)**

- **Definition**: An ADC is a backup server that also holds a copy of the Active Directory database from the primary Domain Controller (DC).
- **Functions**:
    - Provides redundancy, ensuring that if the primary DC fails, users can still authenticate and access resources.
    - Distributes the load of authentication requests among multiple servers.
- **Role**: Improves reliability and performance of user authentication and can be managed from different locations.

### **Active Directory Management**

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
    
    - Users can access resources across the domain with a single login.
2. **Database Replication**:
    
    - Immediate replication of security databases across DCs and ADCs is necessary for up-to-date information.
3. **Sysvol Folder**:
    
    - A shared folder containing updated AD data across DCs and ADCs.
    - Only available on DCs or ADCs.
4. **DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)**:
    
    - Used to restore Active Directory if it fails.
