### Primary Functions:
    
- **Reliability**: Ensures data is transmitted accurately.
- **Windowing (Sliding Window Protocol)**: Controls the flow of data by allowing multiple segments to be sent before receiving an acknowledgment.
- **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects errors in transmitted data.
- **Connection-Oriented Communication**: Establishes a connection before data transmission (used by TCP).
- **Sequencing**: Ensures data segments are delivered in the correct order.
- **Segment Numbers**: Range from 0 to 65535.

### Traditional Method:
    
- PC1 sends a segment to PC2.
- PC2 acknowledges the receipt of the segment before PC1 sends the next one.
- If an acknowledgment is corrupted or lost, communication halts.

### New Approach (Sliding Window Protocol):
    
- PC1 sends multiple segments (e.g., 3) without waiting for individual acknowledgments.
 - Each segment has its own timer.
 - **Acknowledgment** (ACK) is sent when all segments are received successfully. If an acknowledgment is dropped, the packets are resent after a timeout.
 - **Negative Acknowledgment (NACK)**: If any segment is corrupted or lost, PC2 sends a NACK to request a retransmission of that specific segment.

## **Flow Control**

### Why Flow Control Is Important?

- **Prevents Data Loss**: Without flow control, if Device A sends data faster than Device B can process, data might overflow B’s buffer and result in packet loss.
- **Efficient Data Transmission**: It allows for efficient use of the network bandwidth by dynamically adjusting the transmission rate based on the receiver’s capacity.

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Reliable                                   | Non-reliable                         |
| Implements Flow Control                    | No Flow Control                      |
| Slow                                       | Fast                                 |
| Sequencing of segments                     | No Sequencing                        |
| Large header (due to more functionalities) | Small header (fewer functionalities) |
- **TCP**: Used when reliability and accuracy are more important than speed (e.g., file transfer, email).
- **UDP**: Used when speed is the primary concern, and packet loss is tolerable (e.g., live streaming, video calls, Instagram Reels).
