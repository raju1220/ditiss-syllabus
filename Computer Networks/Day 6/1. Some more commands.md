### **Command: A#show int g0/0**

- **Interface is up, Line Protocol is up**:
    
    - The interface is operational, and there is both physical (Layer 1) and data link (Layer 2) connectivity. Connection has been successfully established.
- **Interface is down, Line Protocol is down**:
    
    - This could mean:
        1. **Interface is administratively down**: The interface has been manually disabled using the `shutdown` command.
        2. There is no Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) connectivity or physical connection (Layer 1) is not functioning.
- **Interface is up, Line Protocol is down**:
    
    - This indicates a Layer 2 problem, potentially caused by:
        1. **Clocking mismatch**
        2. **Encapsulation mismatch**
        3. **Keepalive failure**
- **Interface is administratively down, Line Protocol is down**:
    
    - The interface has been manually shut down using the `shutdown` command. To bring it back up, use the `no shutdown` command.
- **Note**: There is no scenario where the interface is down but the line protocol is up.

### **MAC (Media Access Control) Address**

- Also referred to as **BIA (Burned-in Address)**, **physical address**, or **hardware address**.

### **Key Terms**:

- **txload** (transmit load), **rxload** (receive load), and **reliability** are values measured out of 255.

### **Frame Size**:

- **Runts**: Frames smaller than 64 bytes.
- **Giants**: Frames larger than 1518 bytes.
    - **Note**: Runts and giants can be generated if a network interface card (NIC) is malfunctioning or rogue. Modern full-duplex switched Ethernet networks rarely experience collisions, but NIC failure or viruses can still lead to them.

### **Commands Overview**:

- **A#show ip int**: Displays all IP parameters for the interfaces.
- **A#show ip int brief**: A concise version showing key parameters in a horizontal format. Often favored for quick checks.
- **A#show protocols**: Displays the status of protocols configured on router or switch interfaces.
- **A#show version**: Displays the system version, configuration register value, and other details. The default configuration register value is typically `0x2102`.
---
### **Configuration Register Values**:

- **0x2142**: Bypasses NVRAM, ignoring the startup configuration.
- **0x2100**: Boots the device into ROMMON mode.
- **0x2101**: Boots into Mini IOS (fallback version).
- **0x2102-0x210F**: Normal boot.
---
### **Password Recovery Procedure**:

1. Power on the router and connect via the console.
2. Press **Ctrl + Break** to interrupt the boot sequence, entering **ROMMON mode** (or mini IOS).
3. Enter commands to change the configuration register to bypass NVRAM:
    - **800 series**: `set iso-conf-0x2142`
    - **2500 series**: `o/r 0x2142`
    - **2600 series**: `confreg 0x2142`
4. Restart the router.
5. After reboot, when prompted for setup, select **No**.
6. Enter **Router>** mode, and type `enable` to enter **Router#** mode.
7. Run `A#copy start run` to copy the startup configuration to the running configuration.
8. Enter configuration mode with `A#conf t`.
9. Change the password with `A(config)#enable secret <newpassword>`.
10. Reset the configuration register with `A(config)#config-reg 0x2102`.
11. Exit configuration mode with `A#exit`.
12. Finally, save the running configuration with `A#copy run start`.
