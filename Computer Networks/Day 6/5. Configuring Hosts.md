### **Static IP Host Mapping**:

**Static** host configuration allows you to assign names to IP addresses, making it easier to telnet to those routers by name rather than using IPs.
- **Command**:
    `A(config)# ip host B 172.16.20.2 `
    `A(config)# ip host C 170.16.40.2`
- **Explanation**:
    - This command maps the name (e.g., B, C) to the respective IP address (e.g., 172.16.20.2).
    - **Limitations**: You can configure up to **8 static hosts** using this method.
    - This is useful to remember the IPs of frequently accessed routers.

### **Dynamic IP Host Mapping (Using DNS)**:

In the **dynamic** method, a DNS server handles the mapping of router names to IP addresses, eliminating the need to configure hosts manually.

1. **Default Behavior**:
    
    - By default, **IOS 11.3+** has the command `ip domain-lookup` enabled, which makes the router query a DNS server for name resolution.
        
    - **Problem**: If no DNS server is configured and you mistype a command or hostname, the router will enter a loop trying to broadcast and resolve the name to **255.255.255.255** (broadcast address), causing delays.
        
2. **Solution**: Disable domain lookup to avoid unnecessary DNS lookups when the DNS is not configured.
	`A(config)# no ip domain-lookup`
3. **To Configure DNS**:
	- Set the DNS server's IP:
		`A(config)# ip name-server 172.16.50.100`
	- Example:
		`A# b.sunbeam.com`
	- This sends a request to the DNS server (configured with the `ip name-server` command) to resolve **b.sunbeam.com** to an IP address. Once the DNS server responds with the correct IP, Router A will telnet to **b.sunbeam.com**.
4. **Domain Name Shortcut**:
	- You can simplify DNS lookups by setting a default domain name:
		`A(config)# ip domain-name sunbeam.com`
	- After this, you can just type `A# b`, and the router will automatically append **sunbeam.com** to it, resolving it as **b.sunbeam.com**.
---
### **Summary**:

- **Static**: Use `ip host` to manually configure up to 8 hostnames with their IP addresses.
- **Dynamic**: Use a **DNS server** to dynamically resolve hostnames to IPs using `ip name-server` and domain name configuration.
- To avoid unnecessary DNS lookups when DNS is not configured, use `no ip domain-lookup`.
