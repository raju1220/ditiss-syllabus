- **Lease Duration:**
    
    - If a device requests an IP address from the DHCP server but leaves the network shortly after, the lease period will not automatically remain for the full duration (e.g., three days). The lease duration is set by the server, and it is typically based on the usage and network policies. The IP address may become available for reassignment before the full lease time if it is no longer in use.
- **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing):**
    
    - In the early 2000s, a situation occurred where the DHCP server failed, and all IP addresses were discarded. As a result, machines could not communicate over the internet. However, within the local network, Windows devices self-assigned IP addresses in the APIPA range (169.254.x.x). This allowed local communication between machines but no connection to external networks.
- **Unicast and Broadcast Requests:**
    
    - Devices send unicast DHCP requests until 87.5% of the lease time has passed. After that, they switch to broadcasting the DHCP requests. If the DHCP server fails to respond, machines assign themselves APIPA addresses, as seen in Windows 98 and later versions.

### **Tree Architecture**

- **Importance in Transport Layer Protocols:**
    - The tree architecture determines which transport layer protocols (like TCP/UDP) are used in various network configurations. Understanding this is crucial for managing protocol-based routing and network design.

### **IP Address Structure**

- An IP address is composed of:
    
    1. **Network part**: Identifies the network.
    2. **Host part**: Identifies the device within the network.
	- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
	    
	    - ARP translates IP addresses into MAC addresses to allow communication within a local network.
	- **RARP (Reverse ARP)**:
	    
	    - RARP maps a MAC address to an IP address, typically used by devices that don't know their own IP address when booting up.
	- **BootP (Bootstrap Protocol)**:
	    
	    - A precursor to DHCP, BootP requests MAC addresses and assigns IP addresses, allowing devices to communicate over the network.
	- **Proxy ARP**:
	    
	    - Proxy ARP allows a router to answer ARP requests on behalf of another device, thus enabling devices to send packets to a router without knowing its specific IP.
