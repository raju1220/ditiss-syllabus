- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a protocol used by IP networks to send error messages and other control information. Ping and traceroute are both ICMP utilities used for network troubleshooting.
- On both Windows and Linux, the command for traceroute is "traceroute".
- Ping sends ICMP Echo Request messages to check the connectivity between devices.
- Traceroute uses multiple ICMP Echo Requests with varying TTL (Time-To-Live) values to trace the path a packet takes through a network.
- TTL starts at 255 and decrements with each hop (router). When TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded, and an ICMP error message is returned.

***How Traceroute Works?***

Traceroute works by sending a series of packets with increasing Time To Live (TTL) values. Each router along the path decrements the TTL by 1 before forwarding the packet. When the TTL reaches 0, the router sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the source. By analyzing the source of these messages, traceroute can determine the path taken by the packets.
