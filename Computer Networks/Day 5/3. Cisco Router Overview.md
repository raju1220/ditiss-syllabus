- Cisco routers are a popular brand of routing equipment used in various network environments. Many other vendors offer similar router functionality.
- Cisco routers come in both fixed and modular configurations. Fixed-configuration routers have a set number of ports, while modular routers allow for adding additional modules for more flexibility.

- **Important Ports**:
    
    - **WIC (WAN Interface Card)**: Used for serial connections (e.g., S0/0, S0/1).
    - **FastEthernet Port**: For data transfer, not configuration.
    - **Console Port**: Used to configure routers via command-line interface (CLI).

- **Router Memory Types**:
    
    1. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Contains the BIOS, POST (Power-On Self-Test), and ROMMON (ROM Monitor), a minimal OS for recovery.
    2. **Flash Memory**: Stores the Cisco IOS and other files. It is non-volatile and retains data even when powered off.
    3. **NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM)**: Stores the startup configuration that the router reads during boot-up.
    4. **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: Stores the running configuration and routing tables while the router is operational. It is volatile, meaning data is lost when the router is powered off.

- **Working of ROM, NVRAM, and DRAM**:
    
    - **ROM**: Manages the initial boot-up process, running POST and loading the MiniOS or ROMMON if necessary.
    - **NVRAM**: Stores startup configurations that are loaded into DRAM during boot-up.
    - **DRAM**: Holds the active running configuration and routing information, which are lost if the router is turned off without saving to NVRAM.
