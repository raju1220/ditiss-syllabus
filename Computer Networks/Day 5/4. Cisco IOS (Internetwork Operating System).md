- Cisco routers primarily use the **CLI** for configuration, as it provides direct interaction with the hardware, avoiding GUI overhead.
    
- **Important Cisco Commands**:
    
    - **configure terminal**: Opens global configuration mode.
    - **hostname**: Sets the routerâ€™s hostname.
    - **enable secret**: Sets an encrypted password for privileged mode access.
    - **show version**: Displays router details, including IOS version, memory sizes, and interfaces.
    - **show flash**: Lists the contents of the flash memory.
    - **show running-config**: Shows the current running configuration.
    - **show startup-config**: Displays the startup configuration stored in NVRAM.

- **User Authentication**:
    
    - Cisco routers use password protection at multiple levels (user-mode, privileged mode).
    - **enable secret**: Used to set a secure, encrypted password.
- **Saving Configuration**:
    
    - To save the current configuration to NVRAM, use the **copy running-config startup-config** command.
    - If not saved, all configurations will be lost after a power-off.
- **Exec-timeout**: Configures the time before the session times out due to inactivity.

### **Security Features in Cisco Routers**:

- **Password Encryption**: Cisco uses encryption (e.g., `service password-encryption`) to protect router passwords from being exposed.
