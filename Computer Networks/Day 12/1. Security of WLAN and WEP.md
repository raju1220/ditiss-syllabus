Wireless communication uses unguided (radio) signals, which makes it inherently vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks. Therefore, security is a critical aspect of configuring and maintaining WLANs.

### **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**

- **WEP** was the first security protocol designed for WLANs to provide a level of security equivalent to a wired network.
    
- **Purpose**: It encrypts data between the client and the access point (AP) to prevent authorised access and eavesdropping.

### **Access Point Security Mechanism with WEP**

1. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Disabled**:
    
    - By default, the Access Point (AP) can be set to not respond to ARP requests. This means that if a device on the network tries to discover who the AP is (by requesting its MAC address), the AP won't respond.
2. **Enabling WEP**:
    
    - To secure the network, **WEP** must be enabled at the AP. This requires configuring a **WEP password** on the AP.
3. **Access Point's Modified MAC Address**:
    
    - Once WEP is enabled, the AP does not use its own MAC address directly. Instead, it uses a combination of its **MAC address + the WEP password**. This ensures that the AP cannot be accessed without the correct credentials.
4. **Client Access**:
    
    - Clients cannot simply use the MAC address of the AP to connect. They must also enable WEP and configure the correct **WEP password** to authenticate and communicate with the AP. The WEP password is unique and must be shared between the client and the AP for successful communication.

### **Key Points**

- **WEP is a shared-key mechanism**, meaning both the AP and clients must use the same password to establish a connection.
- Without enabling WEP, clients will not be able to communicate with the AP, even if they know the AP's MAC address.
- **Security Limitation**: While WEP was an early solution for WLAN security, it has known vulnerabilities and is considered insecure by modern standards.
