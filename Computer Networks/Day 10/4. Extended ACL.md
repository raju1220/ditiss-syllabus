ACLs can filter traffic based on **multiple parameters**, including the source/destination IP addresses, protocols (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP), and port numbers. This is particularly useful when you need to control communication between specific devices in a network.

---
Consider an example:
PC 1, 2, 3, ... ---- A ---- B ---- PC 10, 11, 12, ...

In this case, **PC 1** should not be allowed to communicate with **PC 10**, while all other devices (PC 2, PC 3, PC 11, etc.) should be able to communicate with each other.

**Commands:**
* You can configure an **extended ACL** on router A to block traffic between PC 1 (IP: `172.16.10.50`) and PC 10 (IP: `172.16.30.50`), but allow all other communication.
	* ` A(config)# access-list 110 deny ip host 172.16.10.50 host 172.16.30.50`
	* This command prevents **PC 1** (`172.16.10.50`) from communicating with **PC 10** (`172.16.30.50`) using **any protocol**. You can specify protocols like `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp` instead of `ip` if you only want to restrict specific traffic types.
	- `A(config)# access-list 110 permit ip any any`
	- This command allows all other communication between any devices on the network, as it permits **any protocol** between **any source** and **any destination**. Like the previous rule, you can replace `ip` with specific protocols such as `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp` if needed.

**Suggestions:**
- If you only want to block specific types of traffic (e.g., TCP), replace `ip` with the relevant protocol (e.g., `TCP`).
- **Efficiency**: Place the **deny** statement first, as ACLs are processed from top to bottom, and ensure you have at least one **permit** statement to avoid the implicit "deny all."

Consider another scenario, where we want only the **`TCP` traffic to come inside and restrict the other** then:

In this setup, we'll permit only **FTP traffic (TCP port 21)** into the network while blocking all other incoming traffic.

**Commands:**
1. **Allow FTP Traffic:
	- `A(config)# access-list 120 permit tcp any 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 21`
	- This allows **only TCP FTP traffic (port 21)** from any source to the destination subnet `172.16.10.0/24`.
2. **Apply the ACL on the Interface:**
	- `A(config)# int g0/1`
	- `A(config-if)# ip access-group 120 in`
	- This applies the ACL on the **GigabitEthernet 0/1** interface for **inbound** traffic.

***Generalized ACL Command Format:***
`A(config)# access-list <number> <permit/deny> <protocol> <source IP> <wildcard mask> <destination IP> <wildcard mask> eq <port>
`
- This setup allows **only FTP (port 21)** traffic.
- All other protocols are blocked due to the implicit **deny all** rule at the end.
- ACLs process rules **top-down**, so specific rules should come first.

In this scenario, you have two networks:

- **172.16.10.0/24** (Network A)
- **172.16.30.0/24** (Network B)

You want the following rules:

1. **Allow all traffic** between the two networks **except** for one specific host.
2. When **172.16.10.0/24** tries to communicate with **172.16.30.100**, only **HTTP traffic (port 80)** should be allowed.
3. Do not let any other request come to **172.16.30.100** other than HTTP.

**Commands:**
1. **Allow HTTP Traffic Only for 172.16.30.100:**
	- `A(config)# access-list 120 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 172.16.30.100 eq 80`
	- This permits **only HTTP (TCP port 80)** traffic from **any device** in the **172.16.10.0/24** network to **host 172.16.30.100**.
2. **Not allowing any other ip to reach 172.16.30.100**:
	- `A(config)# access-list 120 deny ip any host 172.16.30.100`
	- This denies every other request to `172.16.30.100` other than `HTTP`.
1. **Allow All Other Traffic Between the Networks:**
	- `A(config)# access-list 120 permit ip 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255`
	- This permits **any type of traffic** between the two networks **172.16.10.0/24** and **172.16.30.0/24**, except for the specific rule for **172.16.30.100** above.
2. **Apply the ACL to the Interface (e.g., GigabitEthernet 0/1):**
	- `A(config)# int g0/1`
	- `A(config)# ip access-group 120 in`
	- This applies the ACL to the inbound traffic on interface `g0/1`.
