### **Policies**
A **firewall policy** defines the rules and guidelines that determine how a firewall controls and manages network traffic. These policies specify what kind of traffic (e.g., based on IP addresses, protocols, or ports) is allowed or blocked as it flows between different network zones (e.g., internal network, external internet). The main goal is to protect the network from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, and data breaches while ensuring legitimate traffic can pass.

Firewall policies are typically configured based on security requirements, organizational needs, and compliance regulations, and they help enforce the network's security posture by deciding whether to **permit**, **deny**, or **log** traffic based on pre-defined conditions.
