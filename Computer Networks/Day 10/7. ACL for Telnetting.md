Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to permit or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers. In the case of **Telnet**, which uses port 23, an ACL can control which devices are allowed to initiate a Telnet session.

Let's say you have two networks:

- **Network A**: 172.16.10.0/24 (with a PC at 172.16.10.10)
- **Network B**: 172.16.30.0/24 (with a PC at 172.16.30.10)

If you want to configure an ACL that only allows the PC in Network A (172.16.10.10) to Telnet to the router, while denying Telnet access from Network B (172.16.30.0), you would do the following on the router:

### Example ACL Configuration:

1. **Create an ACL to Permit Telnet from Network A (PC at 172.16.10.10):**
	`Router(config)# access-list 10 permit host 172.16.10.10`
2. **Deny Telnet from Network B (172.16.30.0):**
	`Router(config)# access-list 10 deny 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255`
3. **Apply the ACL to the vty lines (used for Telnet access):**
	`Router(config)# line vty 0 4` 
	`Router(config-line)# access-class 10 in`
### Explanation:

- **ACL 10**: Specifies which IPs can Telnet to the router. It permits Telnet from **172.16.10.10** and denies it from **172.16.30.0/24**.
- The **access-class** command applies the ACL to Telnet (on the vty lines), controlling who can access the router using Telnet.

With this configuration, only the PC at **172.16.10.10** (Network A) will be able to Telnet to the router, while any devices in **Network B** will be blocked.
