An **Access Control List (ACL)** in routers is a set of rules used to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on specified conditions like IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers. ACLs act as filters, allowing or blocking packets that meet the defined criteria.

- **Types of ACLs**:
    - **Standard ACL**: Range 1–99.
    - **Extended ACL**: Range 100–199.

    - ACLs are used for security, as they control which traffic can enter or exit a network based on predefined rules.
    - ACLs are composed of rules that dictate which traffic is allowed or denied based on criteria like IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
    - ACLs must be applied to specific interfaces of a router to filter traffic flowing through those interfaces.
    - You must specify whether the ACL applies to traffic coming into or going out of the interface. This is done using `in` or `out` direction.

ACLs are used to enhance network security by controlling which traffic is allowed to enter or exit a router, preventing unauthorized access and reducing network vulnerabilities.
