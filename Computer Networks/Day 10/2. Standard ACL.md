Filters traffic based only on the **source IP address**

 **Commands:**
    - `A(config)# access-list 10 permit 172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0`:
        - This command allows traffic from the specific IP address `172.16.10.10`. The wildcard mask `0.0.0.0` indicates that all bits of the IP address must match, so only this exact address is allowed.
    - `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in` and `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 out`:
        - These commands apply the ACL to the interface, specifying whether the ACL should filter traffic coming **into** or going **out of** the interface.

- Let's say for **another example**, we don't want `172.16.10.0` to communicate and the rest all machines should communicate. Then we will be using these commands.
	- `A(config)# access-list 10 deny 172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0`: For this command, you can replace `172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0` with `host 172.16.10.10`.
	- `A(config)# access-list 10 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`: For this command, `0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255` can be replaced with the keyword `any`
	- `A(config)# int g0/0
	- `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in
	- Here we must write the permit command as well otherwise the router won't allow any other IP if we wrote only `deny` command.
	- These commands should be used in these order. If you reverse the order then `172.16.10.10` will also be allowed since it belongs to `172.16.10.0`.
