
In the context of the Data Link Layer, several protocols address the limitations of HDLC, notably **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**, which includes:

- **NCP (Network Control Protocol)**: A framework within PPP that allows multiple network layer protocols to operate over a point-to-point link. A specific example of NCP is **IPCP (Internet Protocol Control Protocol)**, which is used to configure and manage IP connections.
    
- **LCP (Link Control Protocol)**: This operates within PPP and handles the establishment, configuration, and testing of the data link connection. It emerged during a time when traditional telephone lines were common for data transmission.

### Key Features of LCP

1. **Multilink**: LCP supports multilink capabilities, allowing multiple physical links to be combined into a single logical link. This was especially important during the era of PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), where standard telephone lines typically offered low speeds (e.g., 28.8 kbps).
    
2. **Error Detection**: LCP includes mechanisms for error detection, ensuring data integrity during transmission. Features like a **Quality** metric and a **Magic Number** (a unique identifier used to prevent confusion between links) help manage this.
    
3. **Compression**: LCP supports compression techniques to enhance data transfer rates. Two notable methods are:
    - **Stacker**: A compression protocol that reduces the amount of data sent over the link. Maintains a dictionary (key-value pairs).
    - **Predictor**: Another compression method that aims to optimize data transmission.

4. **Authentication**: LCP provides options for authenticating users before establishing a connection, enhancing security.
	- **PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)**: This method sends the username and password in plain text. It only occurs once at the beginning of the session, which leaves it vulnerable to session hijacking.
	- **CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)**: CHAP employs a three-way handshake for authentication, which occurs multiple times during a session (typically every 10 seconds).
	  Here when the message is sent. It is sent in encrypted format which can only be decrypted by the other router.
		 It uses MD5 hashing for security:
		    1. Router A sends a challenge to Router B.
		    2. Router B responds with a hashed value of the challenge combined with its password.
		    3. Router A verifies this hash against its own calculations. The hash value changes with each challenge, enhancing security.
			This is called as hashing algorithm that CHAP follows.
