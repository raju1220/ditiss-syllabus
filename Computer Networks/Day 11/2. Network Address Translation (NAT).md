NAT is a method used in networking to translate **private IP addresses** (which are not routable on the public internet) to **public IP addresses** (which are routable), and vice versa. This allows devices inside a private network to communicate with external networks (e.g., the internet) by using a public IP.

There are different types of NAT:

- **Static NAT** (one-to-one mapping)
- **Dynamic NAT**
- **Dynamic NAT with Overload (PAT)**
