##### **Overview**

- **Address Size:** IPv6 addresses are 128 bits (16 bytes), compared to IPv4, which are 32 bits (4 bytes).
- **Representation:** IPv6 addresses are expressed in hexadecimal format, allowing for a more compact representation of larger numbers.

##### **Examples of IPv6 Addresses**

1. **Full Notation:**  
    `003A:2B1C:0000:0000:0009:0101:0000:007C /64`
    
2. **Compressed Notation:**  
    `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101:0:7C /64`  
    (Leading zeros can be omitted.)
    
3. **Using Double Colon (::):**  
    `3A:2B1C::9:101:0:7C /64`  
    (Double colon replaces consecutive zeros.)
    
4. **Another Variation:**  
    `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101::7C /64`  
    (Can only use :: once per address to avoid ambiguity.)

- **Network Part (first 64 bits):**  
    Identifies the specific network. For example, in the address `3A:2B1C::/64`, `3A:2B1C` is the network prefix.
    
- **Host Part (last 64 bits):**  
    Identifies individual devices (hosts) within that network. For instance, in the address `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101:0:7C`, the host portion is `0:0:9:101:0:7C`.

##### **Important Note**

- **Double Colon Limitation:** You cannot use "::" more than once in a single IPv6 address, as it would make it unclear how many zeros are represented.

##### **Benefits**

- IPv6 simplifies network identification and allows for a vastly larger address space, making it easier to manage and find networks.

### **Configuring IPv6**

- **`ipv6 unicast-routing`**  
    Enables IPv6 unicast routing on the device.
    
- **`int g0/0`**  
    Enters the configuration mode for the Gigabit Ethernet interface 0/0.
    
- **`ipv6 ip address 3A:2B1C::/64 eui-64`**  
    Configures the interface with an IPv6 address using EUI-64 format, allowing automatic generation from the MAC address.
    
- **`ipv6 ip address 3A:2B1C::1/64 eui-64`**  
    Assigns a specific IPv6 address (`3A:2B1C::1`) to the interface, also using EUI-64 for MAC-based identification. (Assigns 1st IP)
