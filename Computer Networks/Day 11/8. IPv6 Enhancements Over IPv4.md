**1. Subnetting:**

- **IPv4**: Subnetting is used to divide networks into smaller segments for better management and address allocation.
- **IPv6**: The vast address space (128 bits) reduces the need for complex subnetting. Prefix lengths (e.g., `/64`) are typically used, simplifying network design and allowing more straightforward hierarchical addressing.

**2. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**

- **IPv4**: ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network.
- **IPv6**: ARP is replaced by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which handles address resolution, duplicate address detection, and router discovery more efficiently.

**3. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**

- **IPv4**: DHCP is widely used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices.
- **IPv6**: Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) allows devices to configure their own addresses based on network prefix information without a server. Stateful DHCPv6 is also available for more complex configurations but is less frequently needed.

**4. BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol):**

- **IPv4**: BOOTP is used for network booting and IP address assignment.
- **IPv6**: BOOTP is generally not required due to SLAAC, which provides automatic configuration. DHCPv6 can also fulfill similar roles in specific scenarios.

### Summary

IPv6 streamlines many functions previously handled by protocols like ARP, DHCP, and BOOTP, improving efficiency, reducing complexity, and leveraging the larger address space for better network management.
