* **Switches**: Use RAM and a microprocessor to learn and store MAC addresses, improving communication efficiency.
* **ASIC vs. Software**: Switches use **ASIC** (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) for limited functionality, while bridges rely on software.
* **Switch Drawbacks**: Delays occur when too many MAC addresses are processed or when broadcasts overload the switch.

## Duplex Modes
* **Full Duplex**: Uses separate cables for sending and receiving data, allowing simultaneous two-way communication.
* **Half Duplex**: Allows only one-way data transmission at a time.
* **Simplex**: One-way communication without the ability to send data back.

## Network Architecture and Challenges
* **Flat Networks**: Broadcasts are sent to all devices, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies, especially with many devices.
* **Broadcast Overload**: Servers may crash due to excessive broadcasts, highlighting the need for better network segmentation.
