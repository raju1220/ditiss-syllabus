* **Routers**: Connect different networks and prevent broadcast overload by limiting the number of devices per network.
* Routers are very costly and come with limited ports.
* **IP Addressing**: Consists of a **32-bit address** (`w.x.y.z`) and a **subnet mask** that distinguishes between the network and host portions of the address.
* **Classes of IP Addresses** (Note: Classful addressing is largely obsolete, replaced by CIDR):
   * **Class A**: Large organizations (`1-126`, `255.0.0.0`).
   * **Class B**: Medium-sized organizations (`128-191`, `255.255.0.0`).
   * **Class C**: Small networks (`192-223`, `255.255.255.0`).
   * **Class D**: Reserved for multicasting.
   * **Class E**: Experimental use.

## Subnetting

* **Subnet Masks**: Divide IP addresses into networks and hosts, with a strict division line between the two (e.g., `255.255.255.0` for Class C).
* **Subnet Calculation**: Number of possible subnets and hosts can be calculated using formulas like `2ⁿ - 2` (e.g., `2⁸ - 2 = 254` usable host addresses, subtracting network and broadcast addresses).
* **CIDR Notation**: Subnets can be represented with a `/` followed by the number of bits for the network part (e.g., `/24` for `255.255.255.0`). This number represents the count of 1s in the subnet mask when written in binary.
