Port which is a part of multiple VLANs is called as **Trunk Port**.
The link connecting it is called as **Trunk Link or Trunk.**
Ports which is part of a single VLAN is called as **Access Port**.

- **Trunks**: They are indeed necessary for connecting devices within the same VLAN, especially when multiple VLANs need to communicate over a single link between switches.
    
- **VLAN ID Header**: When packets are sent over a trunk, an additional header (VLAN ID) is added to identify which VLAN the packet belongs to.
    
- **Tagging Methods**: You correctly mentioned that VLAN IDs use two tagging methods: ISL (Inter-Switch Link) and 802.1Q. ISL is a Cisco proprietary protocol, while 802.1Q is the industry standard.

#### **Declaring a Trunk**
This doesn't work with 2900 series of switches. This series only has 802.1Q and not ISL.
**Steps:**
1. `switch(config)# int g0/0`
2. `switch(config)# switchport mode trunk`
3. `switch(config)# switchport trunk encapsulation isl`
   or
   `switch(config)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`

**VTP** only works on the trunk link. 

1. `switch(config)# vtp domain <Name>`
2. `switch(config)# vtp mode server` : VLAN database is read and write
   or
   `switch(config)# vtp mode client`: VLAN database is read
   or
   `switch(config)# vtp mode transparent`
3. `switch(config)# password`: optional
