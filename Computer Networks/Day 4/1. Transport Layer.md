- The **Transport Layer** in the OSI model ensures **reliability** of data transmission and is composed of mechanisms like **flow control** and **error control**. It manages data segments by using protocols such as:
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable but slower, ensures data is delivered correctly.
    - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Fast but unreliable, does not guarantee delivery or order.

#### **Port Numbers**

- Ports range from **1 to 65535**.
- **Well-known ports (1â€“1024)** are reserved for system-level services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
- Ports from **4096 to 65535** can be used dynamically by applications for various processes.
- When accessing a website like `https://google.com`, the server sends data to your device on a specific port number, which is included in the **segment** (data unit at the Transport Layer). This port number helps direct the data to the appropriate application on the receiving system.

#### **Port Security and Firewalls**

- An **attacker** may attempt to exploit open ports by scanning them.
- **Windows Firewall** and corporate firewalls like **Honeywell Firewall** block unused or suspicious ports to prevent unauthorized access.
- In secure environments, only the ports required for specific applications are opened, and others are blocked by default.

#### **Session IDs and Multiple Instances**

- A **Session ID** is used to manage multiple instances of the same application. While different applications are identified by their **port numbers**, different instances of the same application use session IDs to ensure proper data routing.

#### **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

- Manages the **MAC addresses** and **Logical Link Control (LLC)**. The Data Link Layer interfaces with both the **Physical Layer** and the **Network Layer**.

#### **Network Layer (Layer 3)**

- Responsible for identifying the **protocol** being used (e.g., TCP or UDP). It assigns the protocol number and routes **packets** to the destination.

#### **Encapsulation Process**

1. **Frame:** Contains data and type information.
2. **Packet:** Contains network protocol information (IP address).
3. **Segment:** Contains transport layer information (port number).
4. **Process:** The data reaches the application that requested it.
