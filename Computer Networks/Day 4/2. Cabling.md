#### **Coaxial Cables**

- **Thinnet Coaxial (10Base2):** Standard with 185 meters and 110V.
- **Thicknet Coaxial (10Base5):** Bigger coating, extends up to 500 meters.

#### **UTP/STP Cables**

- **Category 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (CAT5):** Support speeds up to 100 Mbps (100BaseTx) over distances up to 100 meters.
- **Category 6, 7 (CAT6, CAT7):** Support speeds up to 1 Gbps (1000BaseT).
- **Fibre-Optic Cables:** Can extend over longer distances, up to 40km, using light signals.

#### **Cable Types**

- **Straight Cables:** Used to connect different devices (e.g., switch to PC).
- **Cross Cables:** Used to connect similar devices (e.g., switch to switch, router to router).
- **Rolled Cables (Console Cables):** Used for direct configuration of network devices, like routers and switches. They require a **terminal emulator** (e.g., Putty) to interact with the device's command-line interface.
