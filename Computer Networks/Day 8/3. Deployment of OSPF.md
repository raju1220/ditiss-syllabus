### Scenario:

- **Router 1 (R1)**: IP 172.16.20.1
- **Router 2 (R2)**: IP 172.16.20.2
- **Directly connected** via a single link.

### Steps:

1. **Activate OSPF**: R1 and R2 enable OSPF on their interfaces.
    
2. **Send Hello Packets**: Both routers send Hello packets to the multicast address 224.0.0.5 to discover each other.
    
3. **Form Neighbor Relationship**: They exchange Hello packets and become OSPF neighbors if OSPF settings match (e.g., area ID).
    
4. **Exchange LSAs**: Routers exchange Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) to share information about their networks.
    
5. **Build Link-State Database (LSDB)**: Both routers create an identical database containing network topology information.
    
6. **Calculate Best Routes**: Using the Dijkstra algorithm, each router calculates the shortest path to each network.
    
7. **Update Routing Tables**: Routers update their routing tables with the best routes and start forwarding packets.
