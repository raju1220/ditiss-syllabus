| EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)                                           | OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multicast Address: 224.0.0.10                                                                | Multicast Address: 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6                          |
| Hello (5 secs) and Update (60 secs)                                                          | Hello, LSA and DD                                                   |
| RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol), like TCP. Sends acknowledgement after packet is received  | Here DD is responsible for sending the update every 30 min. No RTP. |
| Metric = Bandwidth, Delay, Load, Reliability of the Link and MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) | Metric = cost                                                       |
| PDM (Protocol Dependent Module): It is made to route any routing protocols.                  | No PDM. Made to route only IPs.                                     |
| Immediate Backup                                                                             | x                                                                   |
| Unequal Cost Load Balancing                                                                  | x                                                                   |
* Immediate Backup and unequal load balancing are not present in any other routing protocols present in the world.
* The metric in EIGRP is also called as distance.

### **Commands**
`A(config)#router eigrp 10`
`A(config)# network 172.16.0.0`
Here 10 should be written everywhere otherwise the routes won't be exchanged. The number here is called as AS (Autonomous Systems)
