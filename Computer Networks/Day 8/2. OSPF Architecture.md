* **Area 0:** called as **backbone area**. The area identifier for the backbone area is 0
* Router with at least one interface in backbone area is called as **Backbone router**.
* Router which are present in more than one are called as **ABR (Area Border Router)**
* **Internal Router**: Router with all its interfaces inside one area
* **ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router):** Â a router that connects OSPF networks to other autonomous systems and external routing domains.

### **Addressing**
OSPF can perform root summarization which happens only when hierarchical addressing is done. 

In OSPF, only the network ID is forwarded and not the actual subnets since it has to maintain a lot of network IPs and so should not be bombarded with a lot of subnets.

### **Areas in OSPF**
##### 1. **Backbone Area (Area 0)**:
- **Core of OSPF**: All areas must connect to it.
- **Function**: Routes traffic between other areas.

##### 2. **Normal Area**:
- **Standard area**: Handles internal, inter-area, and external routes.
- **Function**: Exchanges all types of routes.

##### 3. **Stub Area**:
- **Blocks external routes** (from other protocols) but allows inter-area routes.
- **Purpose**: Reduces routing table size by limiting external routes.

##### 4. **Totally Stub Area**:
- **More restricted**: Only allows internal routes and a default route.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies routing by blocking external and inter-area routes.

##### 5. **Not-so-stubby Area (NSSA)**:
- **Stub area with external routes**: Allows limited external routes (converted to special LSAs).
- **Use case**: When some external routes are needed but full external updates are not.
