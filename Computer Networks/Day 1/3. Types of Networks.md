Networking involves connecting different devices to share data and resources. Below are various types of networks, explained with examples:

---

#### **1. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

- **What it is**: A network that covers a small town or city.
- **Example**: Cable TV networks that connect multiple households within a city.
- **Key Feature**: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

---

#### **2. Campus Area Network (CAN)**

- **What it is**: A network spanning a campus, school, or company.
- **Example**: The **Sunbeam Campus Network** that connects classrooms, labs, and offices.
- **Key Feature**: Limited to a specific area like a university or company campus.

#### **3. Personal Area Network (PAN)**

- **What it is**: A small network for personal devices within close range.
- **Example**: Using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to connect your phone, smartwatch, and laptop.
- **Key Feature**: Short-range communication, usually within a few meters.

#### **4. Virtual Private Network (VPN)**

- **What it is**: A secure network that uses the public internet to transfer data globally.
- **Example**: Employees accessing a company's internal network securely while working remotely.
- **Key Feature**: Encrypts data for privacy and security.

#### **5. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

- **What it is**: A network that covers large geographical areas, often using services provided by telecom companies.
- **Example**: Internet connections through SIM cards or leased lines.
- **Key Feature**: Connects multiple LANs or MANs across cities or countries.

---

#### **6. Server Area Network (SAN)**

- **What it is**: A network focusing on the **physical security of servers** and their environment.
- **Example**: High-security areas in data centers with restricted access.
- **Key Feature**: Ensures servers are in a controlled and secure environment.

---

#### **7. Storage Area Network (SAN)**

- **What it is**: A specialized high-speed network for storage devices.
- **Example**: Enterprise-level data storage systems used for backups and large-scale data handling.
- **Key Feature**: High performance and dedicated storage solutions for businesses.

---

#### **8. Galaxy Area Network (GAN)**

- **What it is**: A futuristic network for satellite connectivity in outer space.
- **Example**: Current satellite communication systems, such as SpaceX's Starlink, are early implementations of GAN.
- **Key Feature**: Envisions seamless connectivity even in space.

---

#### **9. Local Area Network (LAN)**

- **What it is**: A network where all connections and devices are managed by the owner.
- **Example**: Home networks with a router connecting your PC, phone, and TV.
- **Key Feature**: Small area coverage, typically within a building.
