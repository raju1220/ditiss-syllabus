### **Need for Resource Sharing**

- Networks enable sharing of valuable resources, ensuring efficient communication and collaboration.
- Commonly shared resources include:
    - **Data**: File sharing in organizations or cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).
    - **Audio**: Voice communication using technologies like **VoIP** (Voice over Internet Protocol).
    - **Video**: Platforms for video streaming or conferencing, such as **Zoom** or **YouTube**.
