A **routing loop** occurs when routing tables contain circular paths, causing packets to be endlessly circulated between routers.
### Example:
##### Network Setup:
- **A** → **C** → **D** → **E**
- **B** is connected to **A** and **C**, forming a triangle.
##### Routing Loop Scenario:

1. **Initial Routing**:
    - Suppose **A** thinks it should send packets to **C** to reach **E**.
    - **B** might incorrectly route packets through **A** to reach **E**, creating a loop.
    - **C** routes packets to **D** to reach **E**.
2. **Loop Formation**:
    - If there’s a routing error or delay, **A** might send packets to **C**.
    - **C** sends packets to **D**.
    - If **D** has incorrect routing, it might route packets back to **C** (possibly due to **B**'s incorrect information), causing the packets to circulate between **C** and **D**.
**Note:** Delays in sending updates may lead to outdated routes.

### **Solutions:**

1. **Hop-Count Limit**:
    - **Description**: Sets a maximum limit (e.g., 15 hops in RIP) on the number of hops to reach a destination. Any route exceeding this limit is considered unreachable.
2. **Split Horizon**:
    - **Description**: Prevents a router from sending routing updates back to the router from which it received them.
3. **Hold-Down Timers**:
    - **Description**: Temporarily suppresses route changes to stabilize the routing table and prevent rapid fluctuations. The hold-down period helps avoid incorrect routing updates. This is typically set to 180s.
    - Split horizon rules still apply during the hold-down period, but they are not directly tied to it.
4. **Triggered Updates**:
    - **Description**: Sends updates immediately when there is a topology change, rather than waiting for the regular update interval, to quickly propagate changes and reduce the chance of loops.

These techniques work together to enhance routing stability and prevent loops in routing protocols.

These conditions occur due to hop count limit.

1. **Route Poisoning**: When a router finds out that a route is no longer usable, it marks that route as "invalid" by setting its distance to a very high number like 16 which is out of range for hop count limit. This tells all other routers that this route should not be used anymore.

2. **Poison Reverse**: When a router learns that a route is invalid, it not only marks it as invalid but also tells the router from which it learned the route that the route is invalid. This helps make sure that the invalid route doesn’t keep getting used in a loop.
