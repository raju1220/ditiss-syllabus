#### How Routing is Done?

1. **Longest Prefix Match**:
    - The router checks the routing table for the route with the longest prefix that matches the destination IP address. This ensures that the most specific route is chosen.

2. **Administrative Distance (AD)**:
    - If multiple routes to the same destination are available, the router prefers the route with the lowest administrative distance. This value represents the trustworthiness of the routing source.

3. **Best Metric**:
    - Among routes with the same administrative distance, the router selects the route with the best metric. For example, in RIP, this means choosing the route with the fewest hops. Lower metrics are preferred.

AD's for some of the processes are fixed as mentioned in the below table:

| Process   | AD  |
| --------- | --- |
| Connected | 0   |
| Static    | 1   |
| eBGP      | 20  |
| EIGRP     | 90  |
| IGRP      | 100 |
| OSPF      | 110 |
| IS-IS     | 115 |
| RIP       | 120 |
| Ex-EIGRP  | 170 |
| i8GP      | 200 |
| Unknown   | 255 |
