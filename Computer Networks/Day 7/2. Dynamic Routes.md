## RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

- The **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)** is a distance-vector routing protocol used in both **local area networks (LANs)** and **wide area networks (WANs)**.
- RIP's broadcast address: 255.255.255.255. Also called as All ones broadcast.
- Routing entries of **RIP** are denoted with capital **R**.
- RIP calculates the distance on the basis of hop counts.
- Entries with the lower hop count are prioritized and the one with higher hop count are ignored unless the smaller path fails to connect.
- Ex- If you have 6 routers (A, B, C, D, E, F) connected in a rectangular fashion, and you can reach router B from A via C, D, E, and F, then:
	- **Load Balance:** In RIP, this feature allows distributing traffic among multiple routes to the same destination, improving network efficiency and redundancy.
	- **RIP** can balance traffic among up to 4 routes by default. (Equal Cost Load Balance)
	- If configured, RIP can balance traffic among up to 6 routes.

This configuration helps in optimizing network performance and ensuring better utilization of available paths.

Consider we have a standard model, where we have Router A and B with networks 172.16.10.0/24, 172.16.10.0/24, 172.16.10.0/24.
A: 172.16.10.1/24,172.16.20.1/24
B: 172.16.20.2/24, 172.16.30.1/24
