1. **Pinhole Congestion** in RIP refers to a situation where:
	- **Issue**: A single path or "pinhole" in the network becomes overloaded or congested because RIP routes traffic based on hop count without considering the actual bandwidth or load of the path.
	- **Result**: This congestion can occur even when there are multiple paths available because RIP doesn't distribute traffic evenly based on path capacity.
	**Example of Pinhole Congestion**:
	- **Network**: Router A has two paths to Router D: A → B → D and A → C → D.
	- **Issue**: RIP might route all traffic through A → B → D, causing congestion on Router B, even though A → C → D is also available and less busy.

2. **Subnet Mask Issue:** 
	- **Problem**: In **RIP v1**, since subnet masks are not included in the routing updates, all entries in the RIP routing table are assumed to use the same subnet mask as the first entry. This can lead to problems with network routing if different subnets or subnet masks are used within the same RIP routing domain. Here, we are forced to work with FLSM.
	- **Result**: Incorrect routing and potential network issues, especially in networks using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

	**Note**: RIP v2 includes the subnet mask in its updates, addressing this issue.
