- **Classful**: Assumes default subnet masks and does not include subnet information in updates.
- **Classless**: Includes subnet masks in updates, supporting flexible and variable subnetting.

### **Multicast in RIP v2**
Multicast is used to efficiently send routing updates:

- **Multicast Address**: RIP v2 uses the multicast address **224.0.0.9** to send routing updates.
- **Efficiency**: This allows RIP v2 to send updates to all RIP-enabled routers on the local network without flooding the entire network, unlike RIP v1 which uses broadcast.

---
### **Authentication**
**RIP v1**: Does not support authentication. All RIP updates are sent in plain text.

**RIP v2**: Supports authentication, allowing updates to be secured with passwords (clear-text or MD5). This ensures that only authorized routers can participate in the routing process.

---
## **Backward Compatibility**
- **RIP v2** is designed to be compatible with **RIP v1**.
- It can exchange routing information with **RIP v1** routers, although **RIP v1** will not understand some features of **RIP v2** (like subnet masks or authentication).
- **RIP v2** can communicate with **RIP v1** routers, but the additional features of **RIP v2** are not utilized by **RIP v1** routers.
