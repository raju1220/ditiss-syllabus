- **Command**: `A(config)#router rip`: This will set the router to router configuration mode. i.e., `A(config-router)#`.
- `A(config-router)# network 172.16.0.0`: enables **RIP** on all interfaces of the router that have IP addresses in the `172.16.0.0/16` network range. It means the router will advertise and listen for RIP updates on these interfaces, sharing and learning routing information for networks within this range.
- If any other network is directly connected to A for example, 202.208.220.0 then we would be writing that network in the rip configuration mode as well.
  `A(config-router)# network 202.208.220.0` along with the previous command.
- Though, we won't be doing the same for the router B. Since the network is directly connected to A and not B.
  Router B's commands:
  `B(config)# router rip`
  `B(config-router)# network 172.16.0.0`

Examples for the same are in the notebook. Writing RIP scenarios.

1. **Configuration**: Both routers are set to use RIP to advertise their networks.
2. **Advertisement**: Router A advertises `172.16.10.0/24` to Router B, and Router B advertises `172.16.30.0/24` to Router A.
3. **Data Packets**: The RIP control packet contains network information about both LAN and WAN networks, including the network IDs and hop counts. When Router B receives this RIP packet from Router A, it updates its routing table with Router Aâ€™s connected networks and learns about the next hop (Router A's IP address) to reach those networks.
4. **Routing Tables**:
    - Router A learns about `172.16.30.0/24` through Router B.
    - Router B learns about `172.16.10.0/24` through Router A.
5. **Periodic Updates**: RIP sends updates every 30 seconds, keeping the routing tables updated.

Thus, both routers can route traffic between all networks.

*RIP keeps sending the updates on the LAN side where another router is not available. We can change this using a command*:
`A(config)# router rip`
`A(config)# passive-interface g0/0`
`A(config)# network 202.208.220.0` (If we have another network 202.208.220.0 at A connected)
`A(config)# passive-interface g0/2`

Giving the passive interface is equal to not giving a network interface.
**Important Note**: You need the `network` command to enable RIP on an interface, even if you use `passive-interface` to stop sending updates on that interface.

**Important Note:** `passive-interface` does not block or interfere with normal data traffic passing through the interface. The interface continues to forward data packets as usual.

---
**Note:** When we use `passive-interface`, it won't pass any updates to another router but will take the updates from another router.

**Example:**

- **Network**: A is connected to B, and B is connected to A, forming a simple two-router setup: A <--> B.
- **Configuration**:
    - On Router A: `passive-interface` is applied to the interface connected to Router B.

**Explanation**:
- **Router A**: By applying `passive-interface` to its interface with Router B, Router A will not send RIP updates out of this interface to Router B. However, Router A will still receive RIP updates from Router B on this interface.
- **Router B**: Router B will be able to send and receive RIP updates to and from Router A as normal, assuming Router B does not have a `passive-interface` configured on its interface to Router A.
