Consider, we have 3 routers A,B ,and C connected to each other in a triangular fashion.
A : 172.16.10.1/24, 172.16.20.1/24, 172.16.60.1/24
B: 172.16.20.2/24, 172.16.30.1/24,172.16.40.1/24
C: 172.16.60.2/24,172.16.40.2/24
if the path via Router B fails then we have alternate path via C. But this route is not primary, this is an alternate.
`A(config)# ip route 172.16.30.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.20.2`
`A(config)# ip route 172.16.30.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.60.2 5`
`5` here is called as **Administrative Distance** or **AD**.
- By default it is set to 1.
- It can range from 0 to 255.
- Longer the administrative distance, the path won't be preferred. Shorter the better. If for the second command, if we wrote `0` instead of `5`, then the longer path will be preferred since the AD of longer path is smaller.
- Command: `ip route <Destination> <Subnet Mask> <Next-Hop Address> <Administrative Distance>`
	- Command: `ip route <Destination> <Subnet Mask> <Next-Hop Address> <Administrative Distance> permanent`: Here the permanent keyword keeps the static route in the routing table even if the primary option is unreachable.

In the above example, consider C network as 172.16.50.0.
We can see that we have alternate option for every router possible making it 2 options for each router to reach another. To program this, it becomes complicated when the number of routers increase. To overcome this, we have ***Dynamic Routes.***
