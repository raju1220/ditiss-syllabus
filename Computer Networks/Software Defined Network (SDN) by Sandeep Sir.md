### **What is Network Function Virtualisation (NFV)?**

- **Network Functions:** Basic tasks like switching, routing, and other networking operations.
- Traditionally, these functions are handled by physical devices like switches and routers.
- **Virtualisation of Network Functions:** With NFV, these physical devices are replaced with virtual counterparts.
    - Example: When we configured a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** in AWS, we virtually created and managed networking components.

### **How NFV Works**

- An example project is **Open vSwitch (OVS):**
    
    - An open-source project that creates **overlay networks**. These networks function on top of the physical network.
    - Imagine connecting your laptop to a virtual switch, which then connects to the internet.
- Types of Virtual Switches:
    
    - **NAT Switch:** Acts both as a switch and a router.
    - **Host-Only Switch:** Functions only as a basic switch.
- By virtualizing these functions, you no longer need physical hardware for every switch or router. Everything is managed on software, making networks more flexible and cost-effective.

### **Why SDN?**

When virtualizing networks with NFV, someone has to configure all the virtual routers and switches. Doing this manually is **impractical**, especially in large-scale environments with thousands of devices. This is where **SDN** comes in.

### **What is Software Defined Networking (SDN)?**

SDN is a way to manage and control the network programmatically using software, rather than manually configuring hardware.

#### **Key Components of SDN:**

1. **SDN Switch:**
    
    - For example, a **24-port SDN switch** was developed. As the name suggests, it has 24 ports to connect devices.
    - The **functionality is independent** of the hardware, meaning it can be programmed to behave differently as per the network's needs.
2. **OpenFlow Protocol:**
    
    - A special protocol designed to communicate between the SDN switch and the controller.
3. **Controller:**
    
    - A **software-based brain** of the SDN.
    - Most controllers are written in **Java** or **Python**.
    - It provides **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** to allow applications to interact with the controller.
    - The controller manages the **flow tables** of SDN devices.

### **How SDN Works**

1. **Flow Tables:**
    
    - SDN devices have a flow table that contains information about how to handle network packets.
    - When a packet arrives, attributes like the **MAC address** or **destination IP address** are checked in the flow table.
    - If a matching entry is found:
        - The packet is forwarded directly.
    - If no entry is found:
        - The packet is sent to the **controller** for processing.
2. **Dynamic Configuration:**
    
    - The SDN controller automates tasks like adding or deleting entries in the flow table.
    - For example:
        - When a machine is deleted, its MAC address is automatically removed from the controller's records.
        - When a new machine is added, the controller updates the flow table dynamically.
3. **Live Migration:**
    
    - If a running virtual machine (VM) has issues with its server, SDN allows the VM to be **migrated to another server** seamlessly.
    - The entire network adjusts dynamically without manual intervention.

### **Why SDN is Important**

- **No manual configuration:** Eliminates the need to write commands for every router or switch.
- **Dynamic and scalable:** Adapts to changes in the network environment in real time.
- **Cost-efficient:** Reduces reliance on expensive physical hardware.

### **Examples of SDN in Action**

- **Cisco Meraki**: A popular SDN solution.
- **Dell SDN Solution**: Another example of SDN implementation.
- There are many other manufacturers offering SDN solutions.

### **Additional Notes:**

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**
    
    - When you ping an IP address for the first time, an **ARP packet** is broadcast to find the MAC address of the destination.
- **Bridge Mode:**
    
    - In SDN, virtual machines often operate in **bridge mode**, where they connect to the network as if they are directly attached.
