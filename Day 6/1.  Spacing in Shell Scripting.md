    - **Correct:** `val=10`
    - **Incorrect:** `val = 10`

#### **Operators**

- When using operators, **spaces should be included** between operands and operators.
    - **Correct:** `<operator1> <operand> <operator2>`
    - **Incorrect:** `<operator1><operand><operator2>`

#### **Conditional Statements**

- When writing an `if` statement, there should be spaces:
    
    1. **After** `if`
    2. **Before and after** the condition inside the brackets.
    
    - **Correct:** `if [ condition ]`
    - **Incorrect:** `if[condition]` (This generates an error)
