### **Executable File Structure**

An executable file contains several key sections, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Executable Header**:
    
    - Contains information about the program, such as its name and size.
    - Specifies the type of program (e.g., CLI, GUI, library).
    - Provides the address of the entry point function.
    - Includes information about the remaining sections (start/end).
    - Contains a **magic number**:
        - Serves as an identifier for the file format.
        - Takes up 2 to 4 bytes of space.
    - Examples:
        - `.out` (Linux): Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
        - `.exe` (Windows): Portable Executable (MZ)
2. **TEXT Section**:
    
    - Contains instructions in machine code format.
    - Also referred to as the **code section**.
3. **Data Section**:
    
    - Contains initialised static and global variables.
    - Example: `int num = 10;`
4. **BSS (Block Started by Symbol) Section**:
    
    - Contains uninitialised static and global variables.
    - Example: `int num;`
5. **RO (Read Only) Data Section**:
    
    - Contains read-only data, such as string constants.
    - Example: `char* ptr = "sunbeam";`
6. **Symbol Table**:
    
    - Stores information about symbols.
    - Two types of symbols:
        1. **Variables**: Includes name, size, address, section, type, etc.
        2. **Functions**: Includes name, address, return type, and the number and type of arguments.

### Process Execution

- The CPU cannot directly access the hard disk; it requires data to be loaded into RAM for faster access.
- The **loader** is responsible for transferring data from the hard disk to RAM while utilising information from the executable header and symbol table.

### Memory Structure

- **Stack**:
    
    - Stores the Function Activation Record (FAR) and local variables.
- **Heap**:
    
    - Stores dynamically allocated space.
- **Process Control Block (PCB)**:
    
    - Contains information required to control the execution of a process.
    - Stores Process ID (PID) and Parent Process ID (PPID).

### Process from OS Perspective

From the operating system's perspective, a process consists of all its sections loaded into memory along with the PCB.

- The space where the OS is loaded is known as **Kernel Space**.
- The space where user applications run is referred to as **User Space**.

### Commands for Process Management

- Whenever a command is executed, it is treated as a program that is first loaded into RAM, with a PCB created for it.

1. **Top Command**:
    
    - Displays active processes in a top-ordered list.
2. **Echo Command**:
    
    - `echo $SHELL`: Displays the current shell being used.
3. **Process Status Commands**:
    
    - `ps`: Displays the running processes of the current shell.
    - `ps -e`: Displays all running processes in RAM.
    - `ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd`: Changes the format of the output to show specific details (PID, PPID, command).
4. **TTY**:
    
    - Stands for Terminal.
