
### **Redirection in Linux**

In Linux, the three standard streams—**stdin** (standard input), **stdout** (standard output), and **stderr** (standard error)—can be redirected. Redirection alters the flow of input/output for commands.

#### **Basic Commands:**

- `wc`: Returns the number of lines, word count, and character count in a file.
    
    Example:  
    `wc < test.txt`  
    This command takes input from the file `test.txt` instead of standard input (stdin), demonstrating **input redirection**.

#### **Input and Output Redirection:**

- `wc < test.txt > output.txt`  
    This command demonstrates **both input and output redirection**. Input is taken from `test.txt`, and the result is redirected to the file `output.txt`.

#### **Error Redirection and Merging:**

- `wc -p < test.txt > output.txt 2>&1`  
    This merges **stderr** (error stream) with **stdout**, where `2` refers to `stderr` and `1` refers to `stdout`. The command means that both output and errors are written into `output.txt`.

## **How Redirection works?**

1. **Create a FIFO file**
    `mkfifo fifo`
    
    - This creates a **named pipe** (FIFO file) called `fifo`. It's a special file that acts as a temporary buffer for data between processes, ensuring that data is read in the same order it was written.
2. **Sorting numbers from `numbers.txt` and writing them into `fifo`**
    `sort numbers.txt > fifo`
    
    - The command `sort numbers.txt` sorts the numbers in the file `numbers.txt`.
    - The `>` symbol redirects the sorted output to the FIFO file `fifo`, instead of displaying it on the terminal (which is the default behavior of `stdout`).
3. **Reading from `fifo` using `uniq` and removing duplicates**
    `uniq < fifo > output.txt`
    
    - Here, the input redirection (`< fifo`) reads the sorted data from the FIFO file `fifo` and passes it to the `uniq` command.
    - The `uniq` command removes duplicate entries from the sorted list.
    - The `>` symbol redirects the final output (unique sorted numbers) to a file called `output.txt`.

### **How Redirection Works Internally:**

1. **Input Redirection (`<`)**:
    
    - For `uniq < fifo`, the `uniq` command reads its input from `fifo`, which contains the sorted data from the previous step. This replaces the default **stdin** (keyboard input) with `fifo`.
2. **Output Redirection (`>`)**:
    
    - In both `sort numbers.txt > fifo` and `uniq < fifo > output.txt`, the output is redirected from the terminal (the default **stdout**) to either a **FIFO file** or an output file (`output.txt`).
    - The default output stream (`stdout`, file descriptor `1`) is closed, and the new file (`fifo` or `output.txt`) is assigned a file descriptor.
3. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**:
    
    - A FIFO acts like a buffer between two processes (sort and uniq in this case). One process writes to it (`sort`), while another process reads from it (`uniq`). The data is processed in the same order it was written.

### **Summary of Redirection in the Example**:

- You **sort** the contents of `numbers.txt` and **redirect** the sorted output to the FIFO (`sort numbers.txt > fifo`).
- Then, you **read** the sorted data from `fifo` using input redirection (`< fifo`) and pass it to `uniq`, which removes the duplicates and **redirects** the unique data into `output.txt`.

This is how redirection works, allowing you to process data without pipes, instead relying on explicit redirection with FIFO files.
