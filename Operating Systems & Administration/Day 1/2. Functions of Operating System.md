### **Functions of an Operating System (OS)**

The Operating System performs several critical functions that ensure the smooth operation of a computer. These functions can be divided into two categories: core (compulsory) and additional (optional) functionalities.

#### **Core Functions** (Essential for Every Operating System)

1. **Process Management**:
    
    - **Definition**: A process is a program in execution.
    - **Function**: The OS manages multiple processes running simultaneously through **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**, ensuring proper execution and synchronisation of tasks.
2. **CPU Scheduling**:
    
    - **Definition**: The CPU is responsible for executing tasks, but it can only handle one process at a time.
    - **Function**: The **CPU Scheduler** manages which process gets CPU time and for how long, optimising task execution based on priority and resource availability.
3. **Memory Management**:
    
    - **Definition**: The system's **Random Access Memory (RAM)** is where programs are loaded for execution.
    - **Function**: The OS manages the allocation and de-allocation of memory to various programs running in RAM, ensuring optimal use of memory resources and avoiding conflicts.
4. **File and I/O Management**:
    
    - **File Management**: The OS manages how data is stored, retrieved, and organised in files on storage devices like hard drives.
    - **I/O Management**: The OS also handles communication with input/output devices (e.g., keyboards, monitors, printers), ensuring data is transmitted properly between the user and the hardware.
5. **Hardware Abstraction**:
    
    - **Definition**: Direct interaction with hardware is complex.
    - **Function**: The OS provides a layer of abstraction, making hardware accessible to software via system calls and drivers. This layer is usually implemented in low-level languages like assembly.

#### **Additional Functions** (Optional but Common in Most OS):

6. **User Interface**:
    
    - **Definition**: The interface that allows users to interact with the system.
    - **Function**: Provides mediums like **Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)** or **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**, enabling users to give commands and manage system operations.
7. **Networking**:
    
    - **Function**: The OS facilitates network communication, allowing devices to connect and exchange data over local or global networks (e.g., the Internet).
8. **Security and Protection**:
    
    - **Function**: The OS enforces security protocols, protecting the system from internal and external threats like malware, unauthorised access, and data breaches.

#### **Core vs. Optional Functions**

- The **first five** functions (Process Management, CPU Scheduling, Memory Management, File & I/O Management, and Hardware Abstraction) are essential and required in every Operating System.
    
- The **last three** functions (User Interface, Networking, Security and Protection) may not be required in certain specialized systems, like **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**.
    
    **Example**: In a system like an airbag controller in a car, thereâ€™s no need for user interaction, and the OS performs its function without a user interface. **RTOS** is designed to respond quickly to events (e.g., deploying an airbag during a collision), making user interfacing optional.
    

#### **Key Concept: Process**

- A **process** is a program that has been loaded into memory and is actively being executed by the CPU. It differs from a program, which is just a set of instructions on the disk.
