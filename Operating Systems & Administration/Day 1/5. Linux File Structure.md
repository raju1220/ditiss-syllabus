![[5. Linux File Structure.png]]
### **Linux File Structure**

In Linux, the file system follows a **tree-like structure** starting from the **root directory**, denoted by `/`. Every file and directory in the Linux system is organised under this **root file structure**.

#### **Key Directories in Linux**

1. **/boot directory**:
    
    - Contains booting information.
    - The **Linux kernel** and **initial RAM disk** are stored here.
2. **/bin directory**:
    
    - Stores essential **binary files** (executables).
    - Contains basic command executables like `ls`, `cat`, etc.
3. **/sbin directory**:
    
    - Contains binaries that only the **superuser** (root) can execute.
    - "S" stands for **super** (root user).
4. **/etc directory**:
    
    - Holds **configuration files** for the system.
    - Contains settings for the hostname, users, networks, etc.
5. **/root directory**:
    
    - Home directory for the **root user**.
6. **/home directory**:
    
    - Contains home directories for users other than the root user.
    - For example, directories for users like "ditiss" and "sunbeam" are stored here, with appropriate permissions.
7. **/media directory**:
    
    - Stores information about **removable devices** (e.g., pen drives, external hard disks).
8. **/mnt directory**:
    
    - Used for manually mounting removable devices.
    - A sub-directory of `/media`.
9. **/tmp directory**:
    
    - Stores **temporary files**. These files are deleted automatically when the system is turned off.
10. **/var directory**:
    
    - Stores **variable data** files.
    - For example, log files, such as `/var/log/messages`, where the kernel logs system messages.
11. **/usr directory**:
    
    - Stores **user application data**.
    - Sub-directories include:
        - `bin`: User binaries.
        - `sbin`: System binaries for administrative tasks.
        - `lib`: System libraries.
        - `share`: Documentation and shared resources for applications.
12. **/lib directory**:
    
    - Contains **system libraries** used by executables in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
13. **/opt directory**:
    
    - Stores data for **third-party applications** installed outside the default package management.
14. **/dev directory**:
    
    - Stores **device files**. In Linux, even hardware devices (e.g., pen drives, printers) are treated as files.
15. **/proc directory**:
    
    - Contains information about all **running processes** and **system information**.
    - This directory provides a virtual file system interface to kernel data structures.
16. **/sys directory**:
    
    - Contains **kernel module information** and details about device drivers.

### **Special Directories**

- **/dev, /proc, and /sys**:
    - These directories exist only in **RAM** and are created dynamically during boot.
    - They are known as **virtual directories** or **virtual file systems** because they are not stored on the hard disk.

### **Path**:

A **path** in Linux represents a file or directory’s unique location. Paths are separated by `/`.

#### **Types of Paths**

1. **Absolute Path**:
    
    - Always starts from the root (`/`).
    - Example: `/home/ditiss/python/demos/demo01.py`.
2. **Relative Path**:
    
    - Starts from the **current working directory**.
    - Example: If you’re already in `/home/ditiss`, the relative path would be `python/demos/demo01.py`.
