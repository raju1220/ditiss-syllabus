### **File and Directory Operations**

#### **Working Directory**

- `pwd`: Displays the present working directory.

#### **Creating Directories**

- `mkdir <directory>`: Creates a directory with the specified name.
    - Example: `mkdir ditiss`
- `mkdir <dir1> <dir2> <dir3>`: Creates multiple directories.
    - Example: `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`
- `mkdir -p d1/d2/d3`: Creates nested directories in one command.
    - Example: `mkdir -p d1/d2/d3`

#### **Clearing Terminal**

- `clr`: Clears the terminal.
- Shortcut: `Ctrl + L`

#### **Removing Directories**

- `rmdir <directory>`: Removes an empty directory.
    - Example: `rmdir dir1`
- `rm -r <directory>`: Removes a directory and its contents recursively.
    - Example: `rm -r dir2`

#### **File Operations**

- `touch <file>`: Creates an empty file.
    - Example: `touch file.txt`
- `cat <file>`: Displays the contents of the specified file.
    - Example: `cat file.txt`
- `cat > <file>`: Creates or overwrites a file with content.
    - End the input with `Ctrl + D`.
- `cat >> <file>`: Appends content to an existing file.
- `rm <file>`: Removes the specified file.
    - Example: `rm file.txt`

---

### **Copying and Moving Files**

- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copies files or directories.
    - Example: `cp file.txt dir1` (Copies `file.txt` to `dir1`)
    - `cp -r <source> <destination>`: Recursively copies directories.
    - Example: `cp -r dir1 dir2` (Copies `dir1` to `dir2`)
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Moves or renames files or directories.
    - Example: `mv file.txt moved.txt` (Renames `file.txt` to `moved.txt`)
    - Example: `mv file.txt dir2` (Moves `file.txt` to `dir2`)
      In this example, `dir2` should already be created otherwise this command won't work.

### **Shortcut Keys**

- `Ctrl + L`: Clears the terminal.
- `Ctrl + D`: Ends input in file creation (`cat >` or `cat >>`).

---

### **Notes**

- `rmdir` is only used for removing **empty** directories.
- `rm -r` removes **non-empty** directories and their contents.
- When we use touch command on an existing file, then it **updates its time stamp**.
- While creating a file, if you include a **dot (.)** before the file name then the file will be **hidden**. Same for directories as well.
