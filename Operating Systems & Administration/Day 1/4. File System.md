### **File System**

A file system is responsible for organising and managing files on a storage partition. It dictates how files are stored, accessed, and managed on the disk.

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Data Block **:
    
    - Stores the **actual content** of the file.
    - The default size is **4 KB**, but it can be configured during formatting.
2. **File Control Block (FCB, inode in Linux)**:
    
    - Stores the **metadata** (information) about the file.
    - Metadata includes file name, size, permissions, timestamps, and more.
3. **Master File Table (MFT, inode list in Linux)**:
    
    - The area where **File Control Blocks** are stored.
    - It contains the metadata for all the files in a partition.
4. **Volume Control Block(super block in Linux)**:
    
    - Stores information about the **volume** or **partition**, such as:
        - **Label**: Name of the partition.
        - **Size**: Total size of the volume.
        - **Filled/Empty Space**: How much space is used or available.
        - Keeps track of **free data blocks** to allocate for new data.
5. **Boot Sector(Boot Block in Linux)**:
    
    - Contains essential programs needed for booting the system. It is divided into two main components:
        - **Bootstrap Program**: Initialises the system and loads the boot loader.
        - **Boot Loader**: Loads the operating system into memory.

### **What is a File System?**

A **file system** is essentially a way of **organising files on partitions**. It provides the structure for storing and retrieving files on the disk.

#### **Types of File Systems**

Depending on the operating system or device, different file systems are used:

- **NTFS (New Technology File System)**: Used by Windows.
- **ext (Extended File System)**: Commonly used by Linux.
- **HFS (Hierarchical File System)**: Used by mac OS.
- **FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32)**: Often used in pen drives and external storage devices.

Even though the contents of files may be the same across different systems, the **organisation** and structure of the file system vary.
