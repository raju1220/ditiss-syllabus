### **1. Monolithic Kernel**

A **monolithic kernel** is an operating system architecture where the entire kernel operates as a single large program in memory. It handles key tasks such as file management, device drivers, memory management, and system calls, all directly in kernel space.

- Imagine the OS as a team: In a monolithic kernel, the team works together in one big room without dividing tasks into separate areas.
- This enables faster communication between tasks, but fixing issues or adding features becomes more complicated due to tight integration.

In technical terms:

- `.c` files → compiled into `.o` files (object files)
- `.o` files → linked into a single **executable binary** file, which is the **kernel**.

### **2. Micro kernel**

A **micro kernel** architecture keeps only essential functions in the kernel, such as basic process management and inter-process communication (IPC). Other components, like device drivers, file systems, and network management, run in **user space** as separate processes.

- Think of the micro kernel as a small control centre for critical tasks, with most work being handled by "external workers."
- This modular structure improves maintainability and security, though communication between components is slower.

**Monolithic vs. Microkernel:**

- **Monolithic:** Faster, but harder to maintain. If one component fails, the entire kernel can crash.
- **Microkernel:** Slower, but more stable and easier to maintain. One failure doesn't bring down the whole system.

**Examples:** Symbian, MACH

### **3. Modular Kernel**

A **modular kernel** is a hybrid of monolithic and microkernel architectures. It uses **dynamically loadable modules**, meaning only essential parts of the kernel load at startup. Additional modules load at runtime when needed.

- Faster than a microkernel but slower than a monolithic kernel.
- Easier to maintain with no need for IPC. However, if one module fails, the whole kernel can still crash.

### **Linux Kernel**

The **Linux Kernel** is a combination of monolithic, micro, and modular kernel architectures, making it highly versatile.

#### **Static Components**

- **Kernel (vmlinuz)** located in `/boot/`, containing features required at all times.
    
    Functions include:
    
    - Process Management
    - CPU Scheduling
    - Memory Management
    - IO Management
    - File Management
    - Hardware Abstraction
    - System Calls

#### **Dynamic Components**

- **Dynamically loadable modules** loaded into RAM only when needed during runtime.
    
    Examples:
    
    - File System Managers: FAT, NTFS, ZFS
    - Device Drivers
- These modules are called kernel objects with the extension `.ko`.
- Location: /lib/modules/ \`uname -r\`
    

**Note:** mac OS uses a **hybrid kernel** like Linux, combining MACH and UNIX. The kernel is named **Darwin**.
