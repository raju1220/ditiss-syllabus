#### **Default Gateway**

- A **default gateway** enables communication between devices on different networks.
- It is typically a **router** but can sometimes be a **firewall**.

---

#### **Ping Command**

- The **ping** command checks if a device (identified by an IP) is active on the network.
- It sends **echo requests** to the device and expects **echo replies** in response.
- **Key outputs of the ping command**:
    - **Bytes**: Size of the packet.
    - **Time**: Response time (latency) in milliseconds.
    - **TTL (Time to Live)**: The lifespan of a packet in terms of hops (network devices).
        - In **Windows**, TTL starts at 128.
        - In **Linux**, TTL starts at 64.
- **Network Latency**:
    - Communication **within the same network** has lower latency.
    - Communication **outside the network** (via the default gateway and multiple routers) has higher latency.

#### **Useful Commands**

- **hostname**: Displays the name of the current device in Linux.
- **tracert (Windows)**: Traces the route and displays the names of devices along the path to a specific IP.
- **traceroute**: Use the `traceroute` command to trace the route to an IP or domain. Example: `traceroute <IP_or_Domain>`.

---

#### **Subnet Mask**

- Defines how IP addresses are divided into **network** and **host** parts.
- Example: `255.255.255.0` indicates the first three octets are for the network, and the last is for the host.

#### **Five Elements of Communication**

1. **Sender**
2. **Receiver**
3. **Message**
4. **Transmission Medium**: The medium carrying data (e.g., air for voice, wires/wireless for Ethernet).
5. **Protocol**: A set of rules that govern communication.

#### **Ports**

- **What is a Port?**
    - A **logical endpoint** for communication at the **Transport Layer** of the OSI model.
- **Port Numbers:**
    - Range: **1–1024** are known as **Well-Known Ports**.
    - Example:
        - Port **80**: Used by **Nginx** and **httpd** (web servers).
- **To check open ports:**
    - **Windows:** Use the `netstat` command.
    - **Linux:** Use `ss` or `nmap <IP>` commands.

#### **Private IP Address Ranges**

- **Class A:** `10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255`
- **Class B:** `172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255`
- **Class C:** `192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255`

#### **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) Range**

- `169.254.0.1` to `169.254.255.254`

---

#### **IP Types**

- **Private IP**:
    - Used within a private network.
    - Not globally unique and cannot access the internet directly.
- **Public IP**:
    - Globally unique and allows internet access.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
    - Converts private IPs to public IPs and vice versa.
    - Example: **Dynamic NAT**.

---

#### **Static vs. Dynamic IPs**

- **Static IP:** Fixed and doesn't change.
- **Dynamic IP:** Changes when the **lease time** expires.
- **Lease Time:** The duration for which a dynamic IP is assigned to a machine.

---

#### **Networking Layers and Devices**

- **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
    - Uses **IP addresses (logical)**.
    - **Routers** operate at this layer.
- **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
    - **Switches** operate here.
    - **L2 switches**: Operate only at Layer 2.
    - **L3 switches**: Operate at Layer 2 and Layer 3.

- A notable distro: **Matriux**, designed by Manu Zacharia.
