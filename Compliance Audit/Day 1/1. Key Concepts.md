### **What is Compliance?**

Compliance refers to adhering to established guidelines, regulations, laws, standards, and policies governing an organisation or industry.

### **What is Audit?**

An audit is a systematic and independent examination of an organisation's adherence to established laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. The primary goal is to assess compliance and identify areas of non-compliance or risk.

### **Data and Information**

- **Data**: Raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context (e.g., numbers, dates, strings).
- **Information**: Processed, organised, or structured data with meaning, useful for decision-making.

### **CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures sensitive information is accessed only by authorised individuals, using measures like encryption, access controls, and authentication.
2. **Integrity**: Maintains accuracy and reliability of data, preventing unauthorised alteration using techniques like hashing, checksums, and version control.
3. **Availability**: Ensures information and resources are accessible to authorised users when needed through robust backups, disaster recovery, and system maintenance.

### **Privacy vs Confidentiality**

- **Privacy**: Focuses on an individual's control over their personal information (collection, use, sharing).
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures sensitive information shared in trust remains secure and accessible only to authorised parties.

### **Key Security Concepts**

1. **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system, application, or network exploitable by attackers. Examples: software bugs, misconfigurations.
2. **Threat**: A potential event or danger that exploits vulnerabilities, such as cyber-criminals, malware, or natural disasters.
3. **Exploit**: A tool or technique used to leverage vulnerabilities for unauthorised actions.
4. **Buffer Overflow**: Occurs when a program writes more data than a buffer can hold, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
5. **Risk**: The potential for loss, damage, or harm when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Quantified by likelihood and impact.

### **Risk vs Threat**

- **Threat**: A potential source of harm (e.g., an attacker exploiting a vulnerability).
- **Risk**: The likelihood and impact of a threat materialising.

### **Real-Life Example: Web Application Security**

**Scenario**: A company develops a web application storing sensitive customer data.

1. **Vulnerability**: The application has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to improper input validation.
2. **Threat**: A cyber-criminal plans to exploit this vulnerability.
3. **Exploit**: A malicious payload is used to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
4. **Risk**: High likelihood and severe impact, including data breaches, financial losses, and reputation damage.
5. **Confidentiality**: Attacker could access sensitive data.
6. **Integrity**: Attacker might alter customer data.
7. **Availability**: Exploit could disrupt the application, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
