### **Information Security vs Cybersecurity**
1. **Information Security**:  
   - Broad field focusing on protecting all forms of information—digital, physical, or intangible—from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  
   - Encompasses policies, procedures, and controls to safeguard data in various formats.  
   - **Intangible Information**: Hidden or abstract information, such as intellectual property or trade secrets.

2. **Cybersecurity**:  
   - Subset of information security, specifically addressing protection against cyber threats (e.g., hacking, malware, phishing).  
   - Focuses on securing networks, devices, and digital information in online environments.  
   - Protects data stored or transmitted via computers and related devices.

### **Risk Assessment Process**
#### **Step 1: Data Classification**
- Categorise data from most critical to least critical (e.g., high, medium, low).  
- Questions to guide classification:  
  1. What happens if this data is publicly disclosed?  
  2. What are the implications of unauthorised modification?  
  3. How critical is this data's availability to authorised users?  
  4. Is this information personal or sensitive?  
  5. What is the value and relevance of this information over time?

#### **Step 2: Asset Identification**
- Identify all organisational assets (both tangible and intangible) that store or manage critical information.

#### **Step 3: Threat Identification**
- Identify potential threats to organisational assets.  
  **Types of Threats**:  
  1. **Natural Threats**: Fire, floods, earthquakes, landslides, etc.  
  2. **Technological Threats**: Component failures (e.g., hard disks, routers), HVAC system failures, power outages.  
  3. **Human-Based Threats**: Hacking, terrorism, employee misconduct, strikes.  

**Examples of Threat Statements**:  
- *Earthquake damages the data centre (Natural; Availability).*  
- *Hard disk failure causes data unavailability (Technological; Availability).*  
- *Administrator formats servers out of rage (Human; Availability).*  
- *Hacker compromises database (Human; Confidentiality).*  

**Threat Agent**: The person, system, or event that causes the threat.

#### **Step 4: Risk Assessment**
- Identify all threats using the threat list.  
- Evaluate based on historical data and industry trends.  
- Prioritise threats by their likelihood and impact.  

#### **Step 5: Risk Mitigation**
1. **Risk Avoidance**: Eliminate technologies or processes with high risks.  
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Use security measures like firewalls, IDS, IPS, etc.  
3. **Risk Transfer**: Outsource risks (e.g., use cloud services to mitigate hardware risks).

### **Legal Documents**
#### **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
- **Definition**: Contract outlining confidentiality terms for sharing sensitive information.  
- **Purpose**: Prevent unauthorised disclosure of trade secrets, strategies, or proprietary data.  

**Key Elements**:  
- Defines what is considered confidential.  
- Specifies obligations of involved parties.  
- States consequences of breach.  
- Includes duration or termination clauses.

#### **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**
- **Definition**: Contract defining service quality, availability, and performance expectations between a provider and customer.  
- **Purpose**: Ensure accountability and establish clear service delivery expectations.  

**Key Elements**:  
- Defines services provided.  
- Specifies service levels (e.g., up-time, response, resolution times).  
- Includes performance metrics.  
- States penalties for non-compliance.
