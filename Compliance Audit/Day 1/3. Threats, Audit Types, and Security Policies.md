### **Types of Audits**
1. **Internal Security Audit**  
   - **Performed by**: Internal team or employees.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Cost-effective.  
     - Faster due to familiarity with systems.  
     - Can be performed frequently.  
     - Requires fewer external resources.  
     - Tools and processes can be customised.  
   - **Drawbacks**:  
     - Internal bias may lead to incomplete information.  
     - Limited knowledge of new threats and technologies.  
     - Workload may hinder focus on the audit.  
     - Employees may feel underpaid for additional audit tasks.

2. **External Security Audit**  
   - **Performed by**: Third-party auditors.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Expertise in the latest threats and technologies.  
     - Detailed and unbiased approach.  
     - Professionalism ensures thorough evaluations.  
     - Builds client trust in audit findings.  
   - **Drawbacks**:  
     - Expensive.  
     - Time-consuming.

### **Audits by Purpose**
1. **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**:  
   - Checks for vulnerabilities in systems or software.  
   - Determines whether vulnerabilities can be exploited.  
   - Typically performed annually.

2. **Procedural Audits**:  
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of processes and procedures.

3. **Compliance Audit**:  
   - Focuses on adherence to specific laws, regulations, or standards.

### **What is a Security Policy?**
A security policy is a formal document that outlines an organisation's approach to safeguarding its information assets. It defines:  
1. Security objectives.  
2. Roles and responsibilities.  
3. Guidelines for protecting resources.  
4. Procedures for responding to incidents.

### **Separation of Duties**
- **Definition**: Dividing responsibilities among individuals to prevent fraud and unauthorised access.  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Ensures no single individual has complete control over critical processes.  
  - Reduces dependency on one person.  
  - Enhances security by creating checks and balances.
