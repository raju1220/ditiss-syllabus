#### **What is it?**

- **MITRE ATT&CK** stands for **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**.
- A knowledge base of real-world adversary behaviour used to improve cybersecurity.

#### **Purpose**

- Helps organisations understand and defend against cyber-attacks by mapping attacker behaviour to specific **tactics** and **techniques**.

### **Key Points for Interviews**

1. **Tactics:**
    
    - **What attackers aim to achieve (their goals).**
    - Example: Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Data Ex-filtration.
2. **Techniques:**
    
    - **How attackers accomplish their goals (methods or strategies).**
    - Example: Phishing, Exploiting Public-Facing Applications.
3. **Sub-Techniques:**
    
    - **More granular descriptions of techniques.**
    - Example: Spear Phishing via Service (under Phishing).
4. **Threat Intelligence:**
    
    - Maps tactics and techniques to real-world **threat groups** (e.g., APT groups).
5. **Enterprise Matrix:**
    
    - A structured representation of tactics and techniques across an attack life-cycle.

### **Why is it Important?**

- Assists in identifying gaps in security controls.
- Used for threat modelling, red teaming, and incident response.
- Widely adopted in **cybersecurity tools** (e.g., SIEMs, EDR).
