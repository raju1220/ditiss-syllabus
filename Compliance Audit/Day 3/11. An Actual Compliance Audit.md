### **What is a Compliance Audit?**

A compliance audit is a structured evaluation of an organisation's policies, processes, and practices to ensure they meet specific legal, regulatory, or internal standards.

In the case of **GDPR compliance**, the audit focuses on:

- Verifying that personal data is handled lawfully, transparently, and securely.
- Ensuring user rights, data protection practices, and organisational security policies align with GDPR requirements.

### **Steps and Checklist for a GDPR Compliance Audit**

#### **1. Documentation Review:**

- Verify the **purpose of collecting personal data** is clearly defined and documented.
- Check the **privacy policy** for clarity, completeness, and accessibility to users.
- Confirm that a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** has been conducted for high-risk processing activities.
- Ensure there are records of **data processing activities (Article 30 GDPR)**.

#### **2. User Consent and Awareness:**

- Confirm that users are aware of the purpose of data collection.
- Check whether users have provided **explicit consent** before data collection or processing.
- Validate the availability of a **consent withdrawal mechanism**.

#### **3. Data Storage and Handling:**

- Verify that data storage systems are secure and comply with encryption standards.
- Check whether personal data is anonymised where applicable.
- Ensure **data retention policies** are being followed, with data deleted when no longer necessary.

#### **4. Access Control and Rights Management:**

- Audit **who has access** to personal data and validate role-based access control (RBAC) implementation.
- Check for regular **reviews of access rights** and immediate revocation upon employee termination or role change.
- Ensure sensitive data cannot be copied without authorisation.

#### **5. Data Transfers:**

- Evaluate the **purpose and method of data transfers**.
- Verify compliance with GDPR requirements for cross-border transfers, e.g., use of SCCs (Standard Contractual Clauses).
- Confirm encryption or secure channels (e.g., HTTPS) are used during data transmission.

#### **6. Data Security Measures:**

- Confirm the presence of **anti-virus and OS updates** on all systems.
- Audit whether unused PCs or public systems are appropriately secured or decommissioned.
- Ensure critical systems with sensitive data have heightened protection measures.

#### **7. Incident Management:**

### **Practical Activities During the Audit**

1. **Scan Systems and Devices:**
    
    - Audit PCs in **public regions** for outdated OS or anti-virus software.
    - Prioritise checking **unused or rarely used devices**, as they may pose vulnerabilities.
    - Begin with **critical systems** containing sensitive user data to ensure they are appropriately secured.
2. **Conduct Interviews:**
    
    - Speak with employees to confirm their understanding of GDPR practices.
    - Ensure employees handling sensitive data have signed **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**.
3. **Physical Security Audit:**
    
    - Check that server rooms, storage areas, and other secure locations are accessible only to authorised personnel.
    - Confirm there is no unauthorised access or copying of sensitive data.
