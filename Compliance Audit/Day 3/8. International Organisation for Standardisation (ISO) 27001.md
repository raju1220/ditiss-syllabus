**Origin:**

- ISO 27001 evolved from **BS 7799 (British Standard)**, which initially had two parts:
    - **Part 1:** Guidelines for information security management.
    - **Part 2:** Specification for an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- Part 2 of BS 7799 was later adopted as an international standard and renamed **ISO 27001**.

**Complementary Standards:**

- **ISO 27002:** Provides best practices for implementing the controls outlined in ISO 27001.
- Unlike ISO 27001, ISO 27002 is not certifiable and serves as a guideline to help organisations strengthen their information security.
