#### **Imaging Digital Data**

- Imaging creates a sector-by-sector copy of the data, preserving details and avoiding alterations to the original.
- **Linux Command for Imaging:**
    
    ```bash
    dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=/home/sunbeam/test/sdb2.img bs=512 count=8
    ```
    
    - **if:** Input file
    - **of:** Output file
    - **bs:** Block size
    - **count=8:** Copies only the first 8 sectors of `sdb2`
- The size of the target folder (e.g., `test`) must be equal to or larger than the source (e.g., `sdb2`) for successful imaging.
- Always work on the images, not the original data, to preserve integrity.

#### **Software Used**

- **FTK Imager**: An open-source tool for creating digital images.

#### **Note**

- A portion of hard disk space (approximately 10%) is reserved to manage bad sectors.
- **Bad Sector**: Damaged storage area on a hard disk, making it unusable.

### **Steganography**

- The practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection.
- Can hide various types of digital content:
    - Text
    - Images
    - Videos
    - Audio

### **Network Forensics**

#### **NBNS Protocol**

- **NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS):** A networking protocol that translates human-readable names into IP addresses.
    - Part of the NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP (NBT/NetBT) suite.
    - Similar to DNS.
    - Known as **Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)** on Microsoft systems.

#### **Active Directory and Packet Information**

- **Finding Names and IPs:**
    - NBNS packets broadcast computer names and IP addresses.
    - The computer capturing these packets to list names with IPs is called the **Master Browser**.
    - Master Browser is determined by OS level and uptime.
- **Finding Active Directory Usernames:**
    - Use **Kerberos**.
    - Active Directory uses:
        - **LDAP versions 2 and 3**
        - Microsoftâ€™s version of **Kerberos**
        - **DNS**
- **Browsing History:**
    - Check the **DNS query cache** to identify which queries were sent by which user.
- **Detecting Malware Downloads:**
    - Inspect **FTP traffic**. If not present, check **HTTP traffic**.
    - **HTTPS** blocks such websites, but **HTTP** may allow them.
    - Use traffic analysis to trace malicious websites or downloaded items.

- Identify the type of packet carrying specific information to analyze effectively.
