There are five steps that are followed in the IRP:

1. **Preservation**:
    
    - Secure the crime scene: Ensure no digital equipment is removed from the area.
    - Take backups of all storage devices before beginning any analysis.
    - Tag every piece of evidence systematically.
    - Record cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5 or SHA256) for portable storage devices like pen drives.
    - Preserve system logs:
        - Logs are often overwritten using FIFO (First In, First Out) by default. Adjust settings to create new log files once a maximum size is reached.
        - Store logs at multiple locations (e.g., a syslog server) to prevent loss even if attackers attempt to delete them.
2. **Identification**:
    
    - Determine what to investigate based on the nature of the compromise:
        - For instance, if a fake Facebook profile is created, check the browser history.
        - If a file is deleted, investigate user login activities and executed commands.
    - Relevant files to check:
        - `.bash_history` for user command history.
        - `auth.log` for authentication and login records.
        - Note: Deleted commands from `.bash_history` can still be found in `auth.log`.
3. **Extraction**:
    
    - Extract the identified information while meticulously recording the process.
    - Ensure every step of the extraction is documented for legal admissibility in court.
    - Record tools used, steps taken, and capture screenshots throughout the process.
4. **Documentation**:
    
    - Maintain detailed records from the first step to the last.
    - Include:
        - Screenshots.
        - Permissions of files.
        - Timestamps.
        - Every activity or check performed.
    - Proper documentation ensures reliability and accuracy during investigations.
5. **Interpretation**:
    
    - Use the documentation to interpret the data and build a clear understanding of the case.
    - Thorough documentation is critical to prevent misinterpretations and ensure accurate conclusions.
