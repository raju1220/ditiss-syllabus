1. **Who is the first responder?**
    
    - The first responder is the person who first identifies and reports a potential cyber incident. They are responsible for initiating the incident response process, securing the crime scene, and ensuring that evidence is preserved without tampering.
2. **How do you know that your system is hacked?**
    
    - Indicators of a hacked system include:
        - Unusual system behavior or degraded performance.
        - Unexpected or unauthorized changes to files or settings.
        - Presence of unknown or suspicious processes.
        - Alerts from security tools (antivirus, firewall, etc.).
        - Unexpected network traffic or connections to unknown IPs.
        - Unusual login activity or failed login attempts.
3. **What will you do if your hard disk gets suddenly full (possibly hacked with unnecessary files created)?**
    
    - Steps to take:
        - Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further damage.
        - Identify the large or unnecessary files using file analysis tools.
        - Check for unauthorized processes or applications that may have generated the files.
        - Preserve evidence by taking a disk image before removing any files.
        - Scan for malware and investigate logs to identify the source of the attack.
        - Seek professional assistance if required.
