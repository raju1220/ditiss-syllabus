#### **HTTPS Encryption**

1. **Asymmetric Encryption (Handshake):**
    
    - When you visit a website (e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com/)), your browser requests a secure connection.
    - The server sends its **public key** as part of an SSL/TLS certificate.
    - Your browser uses this public key to encrypt a random **session key** (a symmetric key) and sends it to the server.
    - The server uses its **private key** to decrypt the session key.
    
    **Example:**
    
    - **Public Key (Server):** `e3f1a...`
    - **Random Session Key (Browser):** `a1b2c3`
    - Browser encrypts `a1b2c3` using `e3f1a...` and sends `Encrypted(a1b2c3)` to the server.
    - Server decrypts `Encrypted(a1b2c3)` using its private key to retrieve `a1b2c3`.
2. **Symmetric Encryption (Data Transfer):**
    
    - Both the server and browser now use the session key `a1b2c3` for encrypting and decrypting the actual data (e.g., login credentials, form inputs).
    
    **Example:**
    
    - Browser sends: `Encrypted(data)` using `a1b2c3`.
    - Server decrypts: `Decrypted(data)` using `a1b2c3`.

#### **SSH Encryption**

1. **Asymmetric Encryption (Handshake):**
    
    - When an SSH connection is initiated, the client (e.g., your computer) and server exchange public keys.
    - The client generates a session key, encrypts it using the server's **public key**, and sends it to the server.
    - The server decrypts the session key using its **private key**.
    
    **Example:**
    
    - **Public Key (Server):** `d4c5e...`
    - **Session Key (Client):** `x9y8z7`
    - Client encrypts `x9y8z7` using `d4c5e...` and sends `Encrypted(x9y8z7)` to the server.
    - Server decrypts `Encrypted(x9y8z7)` using its private key to retrieve `x9y8z7`.
2. **Symmetric Encryption (Data Transfer):**
    
    - Both parties use the session key `x9y8z7` to encrypt all further communication, including the **username and password**.
    - This ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot decipher it without the session key.
    
    **Example:**
    
    - Client sends: `Encrypted(username: admin, password: pass123)` using `x9y8z7`.
    - Server decrypts: `Decrypted(username: admin, password: pass123)` using `x9y8z7`.

### Key Distinctions in Wireshark:

- **SSH Traffic:**
    - Appears on **TCP port 22** with encrypted packets. The payload (e.g., username/password) is entirely encrypted.
- **HTTPS Traffic:**
    - Shows as **TLS** or **SSL** packets, with encrypted application data. You wonâ€™t see the raw HTTP content without decryption.
