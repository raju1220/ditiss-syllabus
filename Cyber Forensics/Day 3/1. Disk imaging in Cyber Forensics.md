#### Using Containers for Anonymity

- Containers allow the use of tools without installation or leaving a trace.
- Dockerfiles of images are stored locally and can be retrieved even after deletion.
- **Solution:**
    - Pull an Ubuntu image.
    - Access the shell inside the container.
    - Perform tasks; commands will be removed with the container.
However, container logs or misconfigured Docker setups might still leave traces. Deleting images doesn't remove associated Docker metadata unless explicitly cleared.

#### BitLocker Key Storage

- The BitLocker key is stored securely in the system.
- If the motherboard fails, accessing the encrypted hard disk may require recovery keys stored elsewhere.
- Recovery keys are often stored in Microsoft accounts, Active Directory, or printed/saved during setup.

#### Checking Machine Communication

- **Command:** `netstat`
- The use of `netstat` is valid but may add that itâ€™s being phased out in favor of `ss` on modern Linux systems.

#### Netstat Options in Windows and Linux

- **Important Options:**
    - `-a`: Displays all active connections.
    - `-b`: Displays the executable involved.
    - `-n`: Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
    - `-r`: Displays the routing table.
    - `-s`: Displays per-protocol statistics.
    - `-t`: Displays the TCP connections.

#### Showing All Processes

- **Linux Command:** `ps`
- **Windows Command:** `tasklist`
- `ps aux` provides detailed process information on Linux, and `tasklist /v` in Windows adds verbose output.
#### First Responder Steps at a Cybercrime Scene

- **Scenario:** Hacked mail server.
    1. Secure the scene and prevent tampering.
    2. Document the state of the system.
    3. Take backups and imaging of critical data.
    4. Analyze logs for anomalies.
    5. Identify potential entry points and mitigate them.

#### Port Mirroring

- Port mirroring copies traffic from one port to another for monitoring.
- Supported by some firewalls for analysis.

#### Imaging with `dd` Command

- **Disk/Partition Imaging:** Imaging refers to creating an exact copy of the entire disk or partition, capturing all data, including files, metadata, and unused space, for analysis or backup purposes.
    1. Identify the disk using `sudo fdisk -l`.
    2. Create and mount a partition:
        
        ```bash
        sudo fdisk /dev/sda
        sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
        sudo mkdir /mnt/test
        sudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt/test
        ```
        
    3. Perform operations, e.g., creating files, copying configuration files.
        
        ```bash
        sudo nano report.txt
        sudo cp /etc/fstab .
        ```
        
    4. Unmount the partition and image it:
        
        ```bash
        sudo umount /dev/sda1
        sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/image/case1.img
        ```
        

#### Verifying Integrity with Hashing

- Use hashing to verify image integrity:
    
    ```bash
    sudo md5sum /dev/sda1
    md5sum /image/case1.img
    sudo sha1sum /dev/sda1
    sudo sha1sum /image/case1.img
    ```
    
    - Take screenshots of hash values.

#### Copying Images

- Copy and verify integrity:
    
    ```bash
    sudo cp /image/case1.img /demo/
    sudo md5sum /image/case1.img
    sudo md5sum /demo/case1.img
    ```
    

#### Mounting DD Raw Format Images

The image must have a recognizable filesystem to be mounted directly.

1. Mount the image:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /mnt/dd-demo
    sudo mount -t auto /demo/case1.img /mnt/dd-demo/
    ```
    
2. Work with the mounted image:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano test.txt
    sudo umount /mnt/dd-demo
    ```
    

#### Changing Image Extensions

- Rename the image and mount it:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mv /demo/case1.img /demo/case1.pdf
    sudo mount -t auto /demo/case1.pdf /mnt/dd-demo/
    ```
    
- Verify file type:
    
    ```bash
    sudo file /demo/case1.pdf
    sudo file /etc/hosts
    ```
    

#### Mounting Commands Verification

- Check mounting commands:
    
    ```bash
    sudo tail -20 /var/log/auth.log | grep mount
    ```
    
- Look for suspicious activity, e.g., mounting PDFs.

#### Live Hard Disk Imaging

- Live hard disk imaging captures the state of a disk while the system is running, preserving data in its current state, including any active processes or temporary files. This contrasts with regular imaging, which is performed on a powered-off or disconnected disk to ensure data consistency and avoid changes during the imaging process.
- Live imaging carries risks of data inconsistency and should be done cautiously.
    
- **Commands:**

	```bash
	sudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt/test
	sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/image/case2.img
	```
        
    - Regular imaging does not involve mounting and typically uses:
        
        ```bash
        sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/image/case1.img
        ```
