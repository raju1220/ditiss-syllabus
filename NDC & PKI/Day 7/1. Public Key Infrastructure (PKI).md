#### **Definition and Purpose:**

- PKI is primarily used for **authentication purposes**.
- It is an **ISO authentication framework** that employs public-key cryptography and the **X.509 standard** for digital certificates.
- **Root CA** serves as the starting point in PKI, similar to **Root DNS** in the DNS hierarchy.

### **Key Components:**

1. **Certificate Authority (CA):**
    
    - An entity responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates.
    - Types of CAs:
        - **Internal CA:** Operates within private networks (e.g., enterprises).
        - **Public (External) CA:** Provides certificates for public use.
    - **Root CA:**
        - Creates a self-signed certificate (signed by its own private key).
        - Generates a **private key** and a **public key**.
    - **Sub CA:**
        - Issues certificates to final recipients based on requests received from clients.
2. **X.509 Standard:**
    
    - ISO standard that defines how digital certificates are created and their contents (e.g., "Issued To," "Issued By," "Validity Period").
    - Ensures interoperability of certificates between systems.
3. **Certificate Signing Request (CSR):**
    
    - A form containing information about the entity requesting the certificate.
    - Sent to the Sub CA for certificate issuance.
4. **Digital Certificate:**
    
    - A mechanism to associate a **public key** with the identity of the certificate holder.
    - Created and signed (digitally) by a CA.
    - Contains:
        - Identity information.
        - Public key of the holder.
        - CA's digital signature.
    - Used by browsers to validate website authenticity using the public key.

### **Certificate Lifecycle:**

1. **Issuance:**
    
    - Root CA or Sub CA signs the certificate, binding the holder's identity to their public key.
2. **Validation:**
    
    - Browser checks if the website's certificate is issued by a trusted CA in the system's **MMC (Microsoft Management Console)**.
    - If the CA is trusted, the website is authenticated.
    - If not, the browser displays a warning: _"This website is not secure."_
3. **Revocation:**
    
    - **Certificate Revocation List (CRL):**
        - A list of revoked certificates maintained by Sub CAs.
    - **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):**
        - Protocol used by browsers to check the revocation status of certificates in real-time.
    - Example:
        - If a private key is compromised (e.g., for `sunbeaminfo.in`), the Sub CA will revoke the certificate and update the CRL.

### **Entities and Functions in PKI:**

1. **Certificate Authorities (CA):** Issue and revoke certificates.
2. **Registration Authorities (RA):** Verify the identity of certificate requestors.
3. **Certificates:** Provide public key binding with identity information.
4. **Certificate Repository:** Stores issued certificates.
5. **Certificate Revocation System:** Maintains a list of revoked certificates (CRL).
6. **Keys:** Public and private key pairs for encryption and decryption.
7. **Timestamping:** Verifies the validity of digital certificates at a specific time.
8. **Client-Side Software:** Interacts with certificates for authentication.
9. **Users:** Final recipients or entities using certificates.

### **Important Concepts:**

1. **Certificate Revocation and CRL:**
    
    - Ensures that compromised or invalid certificates are no longer trusted.
    - Revoked certificates are added to a CRL maintained by Sub CA.
2. **Digital Certificate Purpose:**
    
    - Binds identity to a public key.
    - Provides secure communication and user authentication.
3. **Root and Sub CA Hierarchy:**
    
    - Root CA is the ultimate trust anchor.
    - Sub CAs handle the delegation and management of certificates.

### **Key Takeaway:**

PKI ensures secure communication, user authentication, and integrity of transactions through a hierarchical structure of CAs, digital certificates, and robust revocation mechanisms.
