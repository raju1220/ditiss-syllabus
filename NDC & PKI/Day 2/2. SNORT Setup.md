## **Common Errors and Their Solutions**

### **1. First Error: `ipvar`**

**Cause:**  
The `ipvar` keyword is used for defining IPv6 variables, but we are using IPv4 which requires the `var` keyword.

**Solution:**

1. Open `snort.conf` and use the find-and-replace function.
2. Replace all occurrences of `ipvar` with `var`.
3. Ensure exactly **11 occurrences** are replaced.
4. Save the configuration file and rerun the command.

### **2. Second Error: `snort_dynamicpreprocessor`**

**Cause:**  
The error shows a Linux-style file path for dynamic preprocessors, but we are working on Windows.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to `C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor`.
2. Youâ€™ll find 14 files in this folder.
3. Open `snort.conf` and update the paths to Windows-style paths.
4. Replace the existing Linux-style paths with the following (around line 248):

```plaintext
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_dce2.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_dnp3.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_dns.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_ftptelnet.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_gtp.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_imap.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_modbus.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_pop.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_reputation.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_sdf.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_sip.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_smtp.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_ssh.dll
dynamic_preprocessor C:\Snort\lib\dynamic_preprocessor\sf_ssl.dll
```

5. Save the changes and rerun the command.

**Tip:**  
To quickly list all filenames, use the following in `cmd`:

```shell
dir /b
```

### **3. Third Error: `snort_dynamicengine`**

**Cause:**  
The `snort_dynamicengine` path is incorrect.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the folder `C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine`.
2. Update the `snort.conf` file with the correct path (around line 265):

```plaintext
dynamicengine C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine\sf_engine.dll
```

3. Save the changes and rerun the command.

---

### **4. Fourth Error: `snort_dynamicrules`**

**Cause:**  
The folder for `snort_dynamicrules` does not exist.

**Solution:**

1. Create a folder named `snort_dynamicrules` in `C:\Snort\lib`.
2. Update the `snort.conf` file with the following (around line 268):

```plaintext
dynamicdetection C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicrules
```

3. Save the changes and rerun the command.

---

### **5. Fifth Error: `normalize_ip4`**

**Cause:**  
SNORT is set up for IDS mode by default, but the `normalize_ip4` rules cause conflicts.

**Solution:**

1. Open `snort.conf` and search for `normalize_ip4`.
2. Comment out all lines containing `normalize` (around line 280).
3. Save the file and rerun the command.

---

### **6. Sixth Error: Missing `white_list.rules`**

**Cause:**  
The `white_list.rules` file is missing.

**Solution:**

1. Create an empty text file named `white_list.rules` in the `C:\Snort\rules` folder.
2. Ensure file extensions are visible to confirm the `.rules` extension.
3. No changes are required in `snort.conf`.
4. Save and rerun the command.

---

### **7. Seventh Error: Missing `black_list.rules`**

**Cause:**  
The `black_list.rules` file is missing.

**Solution:**

1. Create an empty text file named `black_list.rules` in the `C:\Snort\rules` folder.
2. Ensure file extensions are visible to confirm the `.rules` extension.
3. No changes are required in `snort.conf`.
4. Save and rerun the command.

---

After addressing all the errors, SNORT should work without issues.  
To prevent future errors, we will be making some more changes in order to avoid further errors.

---

### **Change 1: Update Rule Paths**

Update the rule paths in the configuration file from (around line 104):

```plaintext
var RULE_PATH ../rules
var SO_RULE_PATH ../so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH ../preproc_rules
```

To:

```plaintext
var RULE_PATH C:\Snort\rules
var SO_RULE_PATH C:\Snort\so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH C:\Snort\preproc_rules
```

---

### **Change 2: Update Whitelist and Blacklist Paths**

Modify the paths for the whitelist and blacklist from (around line 113):

```plaintext
var WHITE_LIST_PATH ../rules
var BLACK_LIST_PATH ../rules
```

To:

```plaintext
var WHITE_LIST_PATH ..\rules
var BLACK_LIST_PATH ..\rules
```

---

### **Change 3: Update Whitelist and Blacklist File References**

Update the references to whitelist and blacklist files from (around line 525):

```plaintext
whitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH/white_list.rules, \
blacklist $BLACK_LIST_PATH/black_list.rules
```

To:

```plaintext
whitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH\white_list.rules, \
blacklist $BLACK_LIST_PATH\black_list.rules
```

---

### **Change 4: Include Blacklist Rules**

Correct the inclusion of the blacklist rules in the configuration file (around line 575):

```plaintext
include $RULE_PATH/blacklist.rules
```

To:

```plaintext
include $RULE_PATH/black_list.rules
```

---

### **Testing the Configuration File**

Once all the changes are made, test the configuration file for errors using the following command:

```shell
snort -i 4 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -T
```

#### **Explanation of the Command:**

- `-i 4`: Specifies the interface to use (e.g., `4` is the interface number).
- `-c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf`: Specifies the path to the configuration file.
- `-l c:\Snort\log`: Specifies the path to the log folder.
- `-T`: Enables testing mode to verify the configuration file.
