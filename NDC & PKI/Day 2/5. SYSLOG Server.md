#### **What is a SYSLOG Server?**

A SYSLOG server is a centralized system that collects, stores, and manages log messages from various devices, servers, and applications on a network. It simplifies monitoring by aggregating logs in one place, making it easier to analyze and troubleshoot issues.

### **Problem Statement**

- Monitoring network traffic manually on individual systems is inefficient and inconvenient.
- Redirecting log traffic to a centralized location allows better management and analysis of logs.
- The solution is to use a **SYSLOG** server for centralized logging.

### **Using Kiwi SYSLOG Server**

1. **Why Kiwi SYSLOG Server?**
    
    - Kiwi SYSLOG Server allows centralized collection of logs, including those from Snort.
    - Note: This is a trial version (14 days), so avoid installing it on the base machine.
2. **Installation Steps**:
    
    - Switch off the firewall of the virtual machine.
    - Install Kiwi SYSLOG Server in the virtual machine (VM).
    - During installation, **choose "Application" mode** (not as a service).
    - Proceed with the installation: Next → Next → Finish.
3. **Testing the SYSLOG Server**:
    
    - Launch the Kiwi SYSLOG Server.
    - Press **CTRL + T** to test the functionality of the server.
    - Ensure that both the base machine and the SYSLOG server VM can **ping each other**.

### **Configuring Snort to Use SYSLOG Server**

1. **Locate the SYSLOG Step in `snort.conf`**:
    
    - `snort.conf` is divided into sections (called **steps**).
    - In **Step 6**, locate the line starting with `#syslog`.
2. **Add the Following Line** (below the `#syslog` line):
    
    ```text
    output alert_syslog: host=<SYSLOG_IP>:514, LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
    ```
    
    - Replace `<SYSLOG_IP>` with the IP address of the SYSLOG server.
    - Note: SYSLOG runs on port **514** by default.
3. **Save the Configuration**.

### **Running Snort to Send Logs to SYSLOG Server**

Use the following command to start Snort and redirect logs to the SYSLOG server:

```shell
snort -i 4 -c C:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l C:\Snort\log -s
```

- `-s`: Specifies that the output will be sent to the SYSLOG server.

---

### **Summary**

- A SYSLOG server allows centralized logging for easier traffic analysis and troubleshooting.
- Kiwi SYSLOG Server is used for this purpose, installed on a VM.
- Snort can be configured to send its alerts directly to the SYSLOG server using the `output alert_syslog` directive in `snort.conf`.
