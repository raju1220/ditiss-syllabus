#### **What is Proxy?**

A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client (like your computer) and the server you want to access (like a website). It acts as a gateway, forwarding requests from the client to the server and then sending the server's response back to the client. Proxies are commonly used for things like improving security, anonymity, and performance (e.g., caching).
