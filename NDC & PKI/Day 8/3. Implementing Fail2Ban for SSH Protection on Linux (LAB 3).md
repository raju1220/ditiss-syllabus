### **1. Install Dependencies on the Victim Machine**

On the victim machine (`192.168.80.128`), run the following command to install `fail2ban` and related dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y iptables python3-systemd fail2ban
fail2ban-server --version
```

### **2. Check the Status of `fail2ban` Service**

To verify if `fail2ban` is running, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```
This will show a `failed` status for now.
### **3. Modify Configuration**

Since we should not modify the main configuration file (`jail.conf`), we will create a custom configuration file (`jail.local`). Follow these steps:

```bash
ls -l /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

### **4. Add SSH Settings in `jail.local`**

Add the following lines to configure `fail2ban` for SSH login attempts:

```plaintext
[sshd]  # Header section for SSH service
backend = systemd
enabled = true
port = 22
filter = sshd
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
```

### **Explanation of Keywords:**

- **[sshd]**: This section specifies the configuration for the SSH service.
- **backend = systemd**: Specifies the logging backend to use. `systemd` allows `fail2ban` to monitor systemd logs.
- **enabled = true**: Activates the filter for this service (SSH).
- **port = 22**: Specifies the port on which SSH is running.
- **filter = sshd**: Refers to the filter for SSH log messages (predefined in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/sshd.conf`).
- **maxretry = 3**: The number of failed login attempts allowed before blocking the IP.
- **bantime = 3600**: The time (in seconds) for which the IP will be blocked after exceeding the maximum number of retries (1 hour in this case).
- **findtime = 600**: The time window (in seconds) in which the failed login attempts are counted (10 minutes).

### **5. Restart `fail2ban` Service**

After making changes, restart the service to apply them:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

### **6. Check `fail2ban` Status**

To check the overall status of `fail2ban`:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status
```

To check the status for SSH specifically:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

### **7. Check `iptables` Status**

To view the current list of blocked IPs and rules applied by `fail2ban`:

```bash
sudo iptables -L
```

### **8. Simulate an Attack from the Attacker Machine**

On the attacker machine (`192.168.80.129`), simulate a failed SSH login attempt:

```bash
ssh shuhari@192.168.80.128
```

Repeat the command three times (with invalid credentials) to trigger the blocking mechanism.

### **Expected Result:**

- The IP address (`192.168.80.129`) will be blocked after three failed attempts.
- On the victim machine (`192.168.80.128`), check the logs to see details of the failed login attempts and the banning of the IP:
    
    - You can use the following to check the logs:
    
    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    
    - You should see logs regarding the failed SSH login attempts and the IP being banned.
