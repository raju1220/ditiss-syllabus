1. **Graphical Passwords**: These are passwords that use images or graphics instead of traditional alphanumeric characters. Users often select points or shapes in an image to form a password, which can be more memorable than text-based passwords.
    
2. **Smart Android Graphical Passwords**: Refers to a more advanced form of graphical passwords where Android devices might allow users to unlock their phones by tapping or swiping on predefined areas of an image or shape pattern.
    
3. **TLS/SSL**:
    
    - **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** and **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. TLS is the modern, more secure version, while SSL is an older version that is no longer considered secure.
    - They are most commonly used for securing web traffic (HTTPS) to protect data integrity and privacy.
4. **Google Titan Key**: This is a hardware security key by Google, used for two-factor authentication (2FA). It provides an extra layer of security by requiring physical authentication in addition to passwords, protecting accounts from phishing and other forms of attacks.
    
5. **CHAP Protocol (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)**: A protocol used to securely authenticate users on networks. CHAP works by periodically sending a challenge message to the client, which must then respond with a hashed value that proves their identity without revealing their password.
    
6. **NFC (Near Field Communication)**: A set of communication protocols that enable short-range wireless communication between devices, typically used in contactless payment systems, access control, and data exchange between smartphones or other devices.
    
7. **Zero Trust Architecture**: A security model based on the principle that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, should be trusted by default. Every request for access is treated as though it originates from an untrusted network, and authentication and authorization are required at every stage.
    
8. **Port Forwarding**: A technique used in networking where specific communication requests are forwarded from one network node (usually a router) to another within a private network. Itâ€™s commonly used to allow external access to services such as web servers or game servers running on devices behind a router/firewall.
