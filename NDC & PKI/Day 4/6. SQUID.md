For this setup, we need to configure **Squid** as a reverse proxy. Follow the steps below:

**Important:** SQUID runs on port **3128** by default.
Make sure that your web server is not running (Apache or Nginx)

### **Preparation:**

- You'll need a fresh machine for Squid setup.
    
- The **Squid configuration file** has over 9149 lines. Check its line count using:
    
    ```bash
    wc -l /etc/squid/squid.conf
    ```
    
- **Backup** the configuration file before editing:
    
    ```bash
    cp /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.bak
    ```
    

### **Steps for Configuration:**

1. **Configure ACL (Access Control List):**
    
    - Search for the `ACL` tag in the configuration file and scroll to the end of the ACL section. In Vim editor, you can use `/TAG: acl` to search.
    - Add the following ACL entry:
        
        ```bash
        acl shuhari_users dstdomain <squid_ip>
        ```
        
    - Place this above the line that says `acl ssl_ports port 443`. This tells Squid that any traffic with the destination IP `<squid_ip>` is associated with `shuhari_users`.
2. **Allow Access for shuhari_users:**
    
    - Search for the `HTTP` tag and scroll to the end of the HTTP section. In Vim editor, you can use `/TAG: http_access` to search.
    - Add this line:
        
        ```bash
        http_access allow shuhari_users
        ```
        
    - Place it above the line `http_access deny !Safe_ports`. This allows the `shuhari_users` to pass through.
3. **Set the HTTP Port for Squid:**
    
    - Find the `http_port` section using `/TAG: http_port`. and add the following line:
        
        ```bash
        http_port 3128 accel defaultsite=<squid_ip> vhost
        ```
        
    - This configures Squid to listen on port `3128` and use reverse proxy mode (`accel`). Replace `<squid_ip>` with the actual Squid IP.
4. **Configure Cache Peer:**
    
    - Search for the `cache_peer` section using `/TAG: cache_peer` and add this line to the end of this section:
        
        ```bash
        cache_peer <apache_ip> parent 80 0 no-query originserver name=<line_name>
        ```
        
    - Replace `<apache_ip>` with the Apache server's IP and `<line_name>` with any name you choose.
        
    - The `0` disables caching (Internet Caching Protocol), and `originserver` indicates that this is the source server.
        
    - For the `cache_peer_access` section, add this to the end of this section:
        
        ```bash
        cache_peer_access <line_name> allow shuhari_users
        cache_peer_access shuhari deny all
        ```
        
    - This allows `shuhari_users` to access the cache peer and denies all other access (recommended for security).
        
5. **Restart Squid:**
    
    - After making the changes, restart Squid:
        
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart squid
        sudo systemctl status squid
        ```
        
6. **Access the Proxy:**
    
    - To test, try accessing Squid through the browser:
        
        ```plaintext
        http://<squid_ip>:3128
        ```

This setup configures Squid to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to an Apache server. Ensure you replace placeholder values like `<squid_ip>`, `<apache_ip>`, and `<line_name>` with actual values specific to your network.
