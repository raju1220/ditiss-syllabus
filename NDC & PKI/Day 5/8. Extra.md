#### **1. What is an Application Proxy?**

An **Application Proxy** acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, facilitating secure communication. It primarily focuses on filtering and handling requests for specific applications (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP).

- **Key Features:**
    - Provides enhanced security by masking the internal network.
    - Can be configured to filter malicious traffic and enforce user authentication.
    - Application Proxies are commonly used in corporate networks for content filtering and data leakage prevention, so understanding their role in securing communication is vital.

#### **2. Why is Internet Explorer Vulnerable?**

Internet Explorer is a **shell-based browser**, meaning it integrates deeply with the Windows operating system and shares resources.

- **Vulnerability:**
    - If the browser is compromised, it could potentially provide attackers access to core OS functionalities.
    - Other browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, operate as standalone applications, reducing this risk.

#### **3. How to Assign a Static IP to a Debian Machine?**

1. Open the network configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
    
2. Modify the configuration for the desired network adapter (e.g., `eth0`):
    
    ```plaintext
    iface eth0 inet static
    address <static_ip>
    netmask <subnet_mask>
    gateway <default_gateway>
    ```
    
3. Restart the networking service:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

#### **4. VPN Access: Private vs. Public Networks**

- A VPN allows connection to **private networks** securely over a public network.
- **Private Network Access:**  
    Employees often use VPNs to securely access company resources like internal servers or tools while working remotely.
- **Public Network Access:**  
    VPNs can also be used to enhance security when connecting to public Wi-Fi by encrypting traffic.

#### **5. Layer for VPN Tunneling and Encapsulation**

- **Tunneling and Encapsulation occur at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) or Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
- Examples:
    - **Layer 2:** L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)
    - **Layer 3:** IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)

#### **6. What is MLAT?**

- **MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty)**:  
    An agreement between countries to share information and assist in criminal investigations, particularly cybercrime cases.

#### **7. Port Number of OpenVPN**

- **Default Port:** `1194` (UDP by default, can also use TCP).

#### **8. Hashing for Integrity**

- **Purpose of Hashing:**  
    Hashing ensures **data integrity** by verifying that data has not been altered during transmission.
- **Example:**  
    A hash of the original file is compared to the hash of the received file. If they match, the file is unaltered.
