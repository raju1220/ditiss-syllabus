### **Setup Overview**

We require two Virtual Machines for this lab:

- **VM1 (One Adapter)**:
    
    - **Adapter**: Host-only (cannot directly access the internet).
    - **OS**: Debian or Windows (your choice).
- **VM2 (Two Adapters)**:
    
    - **Adapter 1**: Host-only (to communicate with VM1).
    - **Adapter 2**: NAT (to access the internet).
    - **OS**: Clear OS (configured as a gateway).

---

### **Goal**

Enable internet access on VM1 via VM2 (Clear OS)

---

### **Steps to Set Up Clear OS as a Gateway**

#### **1. Create and Configure the Clear OS Machine**

1. **Create the VM:**
    
    - Name the VM folder: `ClearOS`.
    - OS Type: `Red Hat Enterprise 64-bit`.
    - RAM: 4GB.
    - Storage: Default settings.
2. **Configure Network Adapters:**
    
    - **Adapter 1**: Host-only (e.g., `VMNET4`) for communication with VM1.
    - **Adapter 2**: NAT for internet access.
3. **Install Clear OS:**
    
    - Attach the Clear OS ISO and boot the VM.
    - Turn ON both Ethernet adapters and verify their IPs.
    - Set a **root password** and click "Done" to complete the installation.

#### **2. Configure Clear OS**

1. **Access Clear OS Admin Interface:**
    
    - Use a browser to access Clear OS: `https://<external_ip>:81`.
2. **Gateway Mode:**
    
    - Configure Clear OS to operate in **Gateway Mode**.
    - Set the **DNS Server** to `8.8.8.8` (Google) or `192.168.80.2`.
3. **Community Edition:**
    
    - Select **Community Edition** and proceed with setup.
4. **Environment Selection:**
    
    - Choose **Education** as the environment.
5. **Marketplace Setup (Optional):**
    
    - Skip installing additional packages for now.
6. **Domain Configuration:**
    
    - Setting a domain is optional and can be skipped.

#### **3. Enable Internet Access for VM1**

1. Start both VMs (VM1 and VM2).
2. Ensure VM2 (Clear OS) is operational and both adapters are active:
    - **Host-only Adapter**: Communication with VM1.
    - **NAT Adapter**: Internet access.
3. Test internet connectivity on VM1:
    - VM1 should now access the internet via Clear OS (VM2).

---

#### **4. Block Internet Access for VM1**

1. **Access Firewall Rules:**
    
    - Use the Clear OS admin interface in the browser.
    - Identify VM1’s **Host-only IP address**.
2. **Create a Rule:**
    
    - Add a firewall rule to deny internet access for VM1's IP.
3. **Test the Connection:**
    
    - Attempt to access the internet on VM1.
    - Internet access should now be blocked.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

1. **Reversed Network Adapters:**
    
    - If **External** (NAT) and **LAN** (Host-only) are reversed in Clear OS, swap their configurations in VM settings.
    - Correct configuration:
        - **External** → NAT (e.g., `192.168.80.164`).
        - **LAN** → Host-only (e.g., `192.168.40.129`).
2. **ISO Issues:**
    
    - Verify the hash value of the Clear OS ISO if installation fails.

### **Summary of Key Steps in Clear OS Interface**

1. Access Clear OS: `https://<external_ip>:81`.
2. Configure Gateway Mode → Set DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).
3. Select Community Edition → Proceed with environment and basic setup.
4. Optionally add firewall rules to block VM1’s internet access.
