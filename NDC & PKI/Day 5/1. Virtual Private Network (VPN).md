### **What is a VPN?**

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows a secure connection between a trusted network and another trusted network over an untrusted public network, such as the internet.

### **Use Case:**

1. **Remote Work Access:**
    
    - Employees working remotely (e.g., from home) need access to the company’s network.
    - Since their public IP or Wi-Fi isn’t whitelisted, they must use a VPN to connect to the company’s network securely.
    - Upon connection, the employee receives an IP within the company’s whitelisted range, allowing them to access company resources.
2. **Accessing Geographically Restricted Content:**
    
    - VPNs are also used to bypass geographical restrictions and access content that might be blocked in certain locations.

### **Why VPNs Are Needed:**

- **Security:** When an employee connects remotely, the company’s network could be vulnerable to attacks if proper security measures aren’t in place.
- **Whitelist Protection:** Similar to whitelisting IPs to allow only authorized access, VPNs ensure that only authorized users (who connect through the VPN) are allowed to access the company’s network.

### **How VPN Works:**

- A VPN creates a secure connection between two networks over the internet.
- The data sent through this connection is **encrypted**, which prevents **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks** and ensures privacy.

### **VPN Functions/Services:**

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of users and devices attempting to connect.
- **Access Control:** Controls who can access the network and what resources they can use.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensured through encryption, which protects the data from unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity:** Assured using techniques like hashing to verify that data hasn’t been altered during transmission.

### **Key Concepts:**

- **Tunneling:** The process of securely transmitting data through a "virtual tunnel" over the internet.
- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping the original data packet in another packet with additional headers for secure transmission.
    - Tunneling often uses encapsulation to protect and route data securely.
