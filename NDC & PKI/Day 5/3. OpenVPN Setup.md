For this lab: we require two machines: **Windows** and **Debian**
Keep the both machines in **NAT**

### **Steps to Configure VPN:**

#### **On Debian (Linux) Machine:**

1. **Install OpenVPN:** Open a terminal and install OpenVPN:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install openvpn
    ```
    
2. **Create the `server.conf` Configuration File:**
    
    - Create a file named `server.conf` in your home directory (e.g., `/home/user/`).
    - Add the following content to the file:
        
        ```plaintext
        proto udp
        port 1194
        dev tun
        auth none
        cipher none
        ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
        verb 3
        ```
        
    - Explanation of settings:
        - `proto udp`: Sets the protocol to UDP.
        - `port 1194`: OpenVPN default port.
        - `dev tun`: TUN device (used for routing packets).
        - `auth none`: No authentication.
        - `cipher none`: No encryption.
        - `ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2`: Assigns IP addresses.
        - `verb 3`: Sets the verbosity level to 3 (detailed logging).
3. **Start the OpenVPN Server:** Start OpenVPN using the `server.conf` file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo openvpn --config server.conf
    ```
    

#### **On Windows Machine (VM):**

1. **Install OpenVPN:**
    
    - Install OpenVPN on your Windows VM.
2. **Ensure Three Network Adapters:**
    
    - Make sure you have two adapters (one Ethernet and one Bluetooth). Bluetooth might not be there.
    - When OpenVPN is installed, a new virtual network adapter should automatically be created.
    - Press `Windows + R` and type `ncpa.cpl`. You can check your adapters here.
3. **Create the `client.conf` Configuration File:**
    
    - On the Windows machine, create a file (e.g., `client.conf`).
    - Add the following content:
        
        ```plaintext
        remote <vpn_ip>  # Replace <vpn_ip> with the actual IP of your VPN server (Debian machine).
        proto udp
        port 1194
        dev tun
        auth none
        cipher none
        ifconfig 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.1
        verb 3
        ```
        
    - Save the file as `client.conf` in a location like `C:\Myfiles\client.conf`.
4. **Start OpenVPN Client:**
    
    - Go to the OpenVPN directory on the Windows machine:
        
        ```
        C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN Technologies\OpenVPN Client\core
        ```
        
    - Run the following command in the terminal:
        
        ```bash
        openvpn --config c:\Myfiles\client.conf
        ```
        
    - Make sure to provide the correct path where you saved `client.conf`.

#### **Testing the VPN Connection:**

1. **Ping the VPN IPs:**
    
    - Now, try pinging both IPs:
        - The actual IP (e.g., `192.168.80.128`).
        - The VPN IP (`10.8.0.1` and `10.8.0.2`).
    
    You should be able to successfully ping both IPs, indicating that the VPN is set up and working properly.
    

### **Important Note:**

- Do **not** close the terminals (both the server and client sessions) while testing the connection.
