## **IP Address Classes**

### **Classes of IP Addresses:**

| Class | Range                       | Subnet Mask   | Purpose                      |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| A     | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255   | 255.0.0.0     | Large networks (e.g., ISPs)  |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0   | Medium-sized networks        |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0   | 255.255.255.0 | Small networks (e.g., homes) |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | N/A           | Multicasting                 |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | N/A           | Experimental/Reserved        |

### **Types of IP Addresses:**

- **Public IPs:** Accessible from the internet.
- **Private IPs:** Used within local networks. Common ranges:
    - **Class A:** 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    - **Class B:** 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    - **Class C:** 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

### **Special IPs:**

- **Loopback:**
    - Range: 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
    - Used for testing and diagnostics (e.g., `ping 127.0.0.1`).
- **APIPA:**
    - Range: 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
    - Assigned when a device cannot get an IP via DHCP.
- **Reserved:**
	- Class A addresses starting with `0` (e.g., `0.0.0.0`) are reserved.

### **IP Assignment Methods:**

- **Static:** Manually assigned by an administrator.
- **Dynamic:** Automatically assigned by a DHCP server.

## **What Happens When You Browse the Internet?**

1. **Visibility on the Internet:**
    - Your actions online are visible to everyone, including potential attackers.
    - **Bots vs. Humans:**
        - A significant portion of internet traffic is generated by bots, not humans.
2. **Bot Statistics (2017):**
    - 48.2% of traffic: Human activity.
    - 51.8% of traffic: Bots.
    - This highlights that the internet is dominated by automated programs.
3. **Protection Perspective:**
    - Protecting yourself online often means guarding against bots, not just human attackers.
