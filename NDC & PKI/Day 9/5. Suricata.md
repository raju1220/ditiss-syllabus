**Suricata** is an open-source, high-performance Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that analyzes network traffic for malicious activity. Itâ€™s fast, scalable, and supports real-time traffic analysis, alerting, and logging, making it a popular alternative to Snort for network security monitoring. It can be called as a lightweight and easy configurable version of Snort.

### **Suricata Installation and Configuration**

1. **Install Suricata**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install suricata
    ```
    
2. **Check the status**: Run the following command to see if Suricata is running. Initially, it should show as "failed":
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status suricata
    ```
    
3. **Edit Suricata YAML configuration**: Open the Suricata configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
    ```
    
    - **Set the correct network interface**: Look for the `af-packet:` section and change it to your working interface (e.g., `ens33`).
    - **Add rule files**: Search for the `rule-files` section and add the following lines:
        
        ```plaintext
        rule-files:
          - suricata.rules
          - local.rules
        ```
        
4. **Create custom rules**: Create a `local.rules` file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
    ```
    
    Add the following rule to `local.rules`:
    
    ```text
    alert icmp any any -> any any (msg: "Kuch Bhi"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
    ```
    
5. **Restart and Check the Suricata status again**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart suricata
    sudo systemctl status suricata
    ```
    
6. **Test Suricata**:
    
    - Ping the machine from another device to generate traffic.
    - Monitor Suricata logs in real-time using:
    
    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
    ```
    

This setup makes Suricata capture and alert on ICMP traffic, similar to Snort, but it's more lightweight and easier to configure. You can further refine Suricata's functionality by adding more specific rules or changing its configurations.
