#### **Root CA (Certificate Authority)**

Once a **Root CA (Certificate Authority)** is created, it is kept secure and **untouched**. It is like a master key that is used to sign digital certificates, ensuring their authenticity. The Root CA is stored in a **secure location** (often referred to as a "locker") and is only accessed for **maintenance purposes** like updating or renewing certificates. It’s highly protected because if it’s compromised, the entire system of trust in certificates can break.

#### **What is Frisking?**

**Frisking** refers to the act of **searching someone or something thoroughly** to make sure they are not carrying anything illegal, harmful, or suspicious. It is often used in the context of security, like airport security where officers frisk passengers to check for dangerous items. In a **cybersecurity** context, frisking could mean scanning or inspecting data or systems to ensure they are secure and not compromised.

#### **Difference Between Package, Module, Library, and Dependency:**

- **Package**: A **package** is a bundle of code that includes files, modules, and metadata. It typically contains everything needed to install and use a specific tool or feature in a programming environment. In simple terms, it's a collection of related files.
    
- **Module**: A **module** is a **single file** (or a collection of files) that contains code written to accomplish a specific task or function. In languages like Python, a module can be a file that defines functions, classes, or variables to be used in other programs. It’s like a building block of a package.
    
- **Library**: A **library** is a collection of **modules** or **pre-written code** that can be used by other programs to perform common tasks. For example, a math library might provide functions to perform complex mathematical operations, so you don’t have to write the code yourself.
    
- **Dependency**: A **dependency** is an **external package, module, or library** that a program or project needs in order to work properly. Dependencies are things your project relies on to function. For example, if you're building a web application, you might have a dependency on a package like **React** or **Express**.
