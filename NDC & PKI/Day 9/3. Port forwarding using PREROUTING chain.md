### **Setup Details**

- **Machine**: Debian (`192.168.80.128`)
- **Service**: Apache installed (default port: 80)

---

## **Objective**

Use **PREROUTING** in the NAT table to perform **dynamic NAT** (port forwarding). Redirect traffic from port `8000` to port `80` on the same machine.

---

### **Steps**

1. **Run the PREROUTING Command**  
    Execute the following command to configure port forwarding:
    
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8000 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
    ```
    
    **Explanation**:
    
    - **`-t nat`**: Use the NAT table.
    - **`-A PREROUTING`**: Append the rule to the PREROUTING chain.
    - **`-p tcp`**: Match TCP packets.
    - **`--dport 8000`**: Match packets destined for port 8000.
    - **`-j REDIRECT`**: Redirect the packet.
    - **`--to-port 80`**: Redirect to port 80 (where Apache is listening).
2. **Verify the Rule**  
    Check if the rule has been added successfully:
    
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
    ```
    
    This will display the NAT table rules, including the newly added PREROUTING rule.

### **Test the Setup**

1. Open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to test:
    
    ```bash
    curl http://192.168.80.128:8000
    ```
    
    If configured correctly, this will serve content from Apache (running on port 80).
    
2. **Traffic Behavior**
    
    - Any traffic sent to port `8000` is automatically forwarded to port `80`.

---

### **Conclusion**

This simple rule dynamically forwards traffic from one port to another using iptables' NAT table and the PREROUTING chain.
