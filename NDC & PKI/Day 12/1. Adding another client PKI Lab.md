To create and configure a new client with your Root CA and Sub CA in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) setup, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create a New Client

1. **Generate a Private Key for the Client**:
    
    - Use OpenSSL to generate a private key for the new client:
        
        ```bash
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out www.shuhari.local.key.pem -aes256
        ```
        
2. **Create a New Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**:
    
    - Create a CSR for the new client using the private key you just created:
        
        ```bash
        openssl req -new -key www.shuhari.local.key.pem -out www.shuhari.local.csr
        ```
        
    - You will be prompted to enter details like the common name (CN), organization, and location. Make sure to enter the correct details.
        
3. **Export the CSR**:
    
    - The CSR (`www.shuhari.local.csr`) is now ready. This will be exported and imported into the Sub CA.

### Step 2: Import the CSR into Sub CA and Issue the Certificate

1. **Import the CSR into Sub CA**:
    
    - On your Sub CA machine, import the CSR for signing. You can use OpenSSL to create a certificate signed by the Sub CA:
        
        ```bash
        openssl ca -in www.shuhari.local.csr -out www.shuhari.local.crt -cert /path/to/sub_ca_cert.pem -keyfile /path/to/sub_ca_private_key.pem
        ```
        
    - This will issue the certificate (`www.shuhari.local.crt`) signed by your Sub CA.
        
2. **Verify and Issue the Certificate**:
    
    - Check the details of the certificate. If everything looks good, click OK to issue the certificate.

### Step 3: Export the Signed Certificate from Sub CA

1. **Export the Signed Certificate**:
    - Export the certificate from the Sub CA for chain of trust purposes:
        
        ```bash
        openssl pkcs12 -export -out www.shuhari.local-chain.pem -inkey /path/to/sub_ca_private_key.pem -in www.shuhari.local.crt -certfile /path/to/root_ca_cert.pem
        ```
        
    - This will create a certificate chain file (`www.shuhari.local-chain.pem`) that includes both the signed certificate and the intermediate/root CA certificates.
        

### Step 4: Export the Client’s Private Key

1. **Export the Client’s Private Key**:
    - You may need to export the client’s private key in a format that can be imported into a key management system or a certificate store:
        
        ```bash
        openssl pkcs12 -export -out www.shuhari.local.pfx -inkey www.shuhari.local.key.pem -in www.shuhari.local.crt -certfile www.shuhari.local-chain.pem
        ```
        

### Step 5: Set Up Apache2 Configuration

1. **Configure Apache2 to Use the Client Certificate**:
    
    - Assuming you’ve set up Apache2 for your PKI lab, you should configure it to use the client certificate.
    - Modify your Apache2 SSL configuration to point to the necessary certificate files:
        
        ```bash
        SSLCertificateFile /path/to/www.shuhari.local.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/www.shuhari.local.key.pem
        SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/www.shuhari.local-chain.pem
        ```
        
2. **Test the Configuration**:
    
    - Ensure that the Apache server is configured properly and restart it:
        
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart apache2
        ```
        

### Step 6: Ensure Name Resolution

1. **Check Name Resolution**:
    
    - Make sure that DNS resolution works correctly, especially for `www.shuhari.local`. You can verify this using:
        
        ```bash
        nslookup www.shuhari.local
        ```
        
2. **Test SSL/TLS Connection**:
    
    - Test the client-server connection using `curl` or a browser to verify that the SSL/TLS certificate is correctly applied:
        
        ```bash
        curl https://www.shuhari.local
        ```
        

### Files to Export for the Client

- `006-www.xdb`: This file is database or a key store related to the client.
- `www.shuhari.local-chain.pem`: The certificate chain file.
- `www.shuhari.local.crt`: The certificate for the client.
- `www.shuhari.local.key.pem`: The private key for the client.
- `www.shuhari.local.pem`: A combined certificate file, which may include both the client's certificate and the chain.
