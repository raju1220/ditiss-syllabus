### **International Cryptography Restrictions**

- Different countries impose restrictions on the import and use of cryptography.
- Imported cryptographic systems may include backdoors for government access or require user registration.
- The goal of these restrictions varies, from national security to monitoring citizens' communications.
- **For detailed information:** [Cryptographic Restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_the_import_of_cryptography#:~:text=Imported%20cryptography%20may%20have%20backdoors,the%20use%20of%20cryptography%20is).

### **Introduction to Aadhaar and e-Sign**

- **Aadhaar Number**: A unique 12-digit identification number issued by the Government of India.
- **e-Sign**:
    - A digital signature service provided by the government.
    - Enables Aadhaar cardholders to electronically sign documents quickly and securely.
    - It adheres to IT Act, 2000 for legal validity.
- Aadhaar serves as proof of identity and address, widely used for authentication in digital services.

### **Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**

- A collection of standards for public-key cryptography developed by RSA Security LLC.
- **Total Standards**: 15 (PKCS #1 to PKCS #15).
- Examples include:
    - **PKCS #1**: RSA Cryptography Standard.
    - **PKCS #12**: Personal Information Exchange Syntax.
- **For more details:** [PKCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS).

### **FIPS 140-2**

- **Full Form**: Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2.
- **Purpose**:
    - A U.S. government standard for validating cryptographic modules.
    - Specifies security requirements that cryptographic modules must meet to ensure reliable data protection.
- Used widely in government and industry for secure applications.
- **For details:** [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2).

### **SSL/TLS**

- **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**: Older version of TLS.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Modern and more secure version of SSL.
- Used to establish secure communication between servers and clients (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Key Difference**: TLS offers stronger encryption and improved security protocols over SSL.
- **For more information:** [SSL/TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/).

### **Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)**

- Defines the supported document types for web services and email communication.
- Provides encryption and digital signatures to ensure secure and reliable email exchanges.

---

### **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**

- A widely used data encryption and decryption program.
- Based on the **OpenPGP Standard (RFC 4880)**.
- Ensures secure email communication and file encryption.

### **ip6tables**

- Similar to `iptables`, but specifically for IPv6.
- Functionality and usage remain the same as `iptables` (which is for IPv4).
- Used for configuring network packet filtering and NAT rules in IPv6 networks.
