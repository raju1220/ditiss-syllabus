1. **Quantum Computers or Quantum Computing**  
    Quantum computing uses quantum-mechanical phenomena (like superposition and entanglement) to perform operations on data, enabling faster problem-solving for specific tasks like cryptography and optimization.
    
2. **OSI Model**  
    A 7-layer architecture used to standardize communication in networks:
    
    - **Application**, **Presentation**, **Session**, **Transport**, **Network**, **Data Link**, and **Physical** layers.
3. **ACL in Routers**  
    Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to filter and control traffic in routers, functioning similarly to firewalls by allowing or denying traffic based on specified rules.
    
4. **What is a Payload?**  
    The payload is the actual data carried by a packet, excluding headers and metadata. It is the core content delivered from source to destination.
    
5. **Kernel Space vs. User Space Modules**
    
    - **Kernel Space:** Code that runs directly in the operating system’s core (e.g., drivers, netfilter).
    - **User Space:** Code that runs outside the OS kernel, in the user environment (e.g., iptables).
6. **3-Way Handshake in TCP Protocol**  
    **Connection Establishment:**
    
    - Client → **SYN** → Server
    - Server → **SYN-ACK** → Client
    - Client → **ACK** → Server  
        **Connection Termination:**
    - Initiator → **FIN** → Receiver
    - Receiver → **ACK** + **FIN** → Initiator
    - Initiator → **ACK** → Receiver

![[3. iptables-save-configuration.png]]

This diagram explains two approaches for saving **iptables configuration** in a Linux system: **manual** and **automated**. Both ensure that iptables rules persist across system reboots. Here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Manual Approach**

- **Write Bash Script → Execute After Recovery Boot**:
    
    - In this method, you manually write a **Bash script** containing your `iptables` rules.
    - The script is **executed manually** after a system reboot or recovery to re-apply the saved rules.
    - **Limitations**: If you forget to execute the script or if it’s not automated, the rules will not persist after reboot. This method relies on human intervention.
- **Using `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore`**:
    
    - **`iptables-save`**: This command saves the current `iptables` rules to a file, typically `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` for IPv4.
        
        ```bash
        sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
        ```
        
    - **`iptables-restore`**: After reboot, you can restore the rules using the saved file:
        
        ```bash
        sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
        ```
        
    - Here, **`/etc/iptables/rules.v4`** acts as a storage location for the rules.

---

### **2. Automated Approach**

- This approach ensures that `iptables` rules are automatically reloaded after a reboot, removing the need for manual execution.
- **`iptables-persistent`**:
    - The `iptables-persistent` package automatically saves and restores `iptables` rules during reboot.
    - Steps to implement:
        - Install `iptables-persistent`:
            
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
            ```
            
        - Save your current rules:
            
            ```bash
            sudo netfilter-persistent save
            ```
            
        - After reboot, the rules will be **automatically restored**.

---

### **Summary of the Diagram**

- **Manual Method**:
    
    - Either write a Bash script (and execute manually after reboot)
    - Or use `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` to persist the rules via `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`.
- **Automated Method**:
    
    - Use the **`iptables-persistent`** package, which automates the saving and restoration of iptables rules.

Both methods are correct, but **automated** is preferable for reliability, especially in production environments, because it reduces manual intervention. The diagram accurately explains both approaches.
