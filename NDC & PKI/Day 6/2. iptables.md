### **Overview**

- **iptables** is the built-in Linux Firewall.
- It operates in two spaces:
    1. **iptables**: User-space module.
    2. **netfilter**: Kernel-space module.

---

### **Structure of iptables**

- **iptables** is a collection of **tables**.
- Each table contains **chains**, and each chain holds a set of **rules**.
- **Rules** define actions to take, and these actions are referred to as **targets** (e.g., allow, drop).

---

### **Tables in iptables**

There are **five tables** in iptables:

1. **Filter Table** (Default Table)
    
    - Used to implement firewall features.
    - Primarily used for writing traffic filtering rules.
2. **RAW Table**
    
    - Used for configuring packets before connection tracking.
3. **NAT Table**
    
    - Handles Network Address Translation (NAT) for packets.
4. **Mangle Table**
    
    - Used for packet alteration, such as changing the headers.
5. **Security Table**
    
    - Adds security policies using SELinux or similar frameworks.

---

### **Chains in the Filter Table**

The **Filter Table** (default) has three pre-defined chains:

1. **Input Chain**
    
    - Rules for incoming traffic (packets destined for your machine).
2. **Output Chain**
    
    - Rules for outgoing traffic (packets originating from your machine).
3. **Forward Chain**
    
    - Rules for traffic passing through your machine.
    - This applies when your machine acts as a router.

---

### **Rules and Targets**

- **Rules** define conditions for packet filtering (e.g., protocol, port number).
- Each rule specifies a **target**:
    - **A (Allow):** Accept the packet.
    - **D (Drop):** Block the packet.

### **How Rules Work in iptables**

1. **Sequential Processing:**
    
    - Rules are checked **sequentially** from top to bottom.
    - Once a rule matches, no further rules are evaluated.
    - Therefore, the **order of rules** is **critical**.
2. **Default Policy:**
    
    - Each chain has a default policy (either **Accept** or **Drop**).
    - If no rules match, the default policy decides the packet’s fate.

### **Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Sequential Rule Matching**

- Example Rules:
    
    1. **A TCP 80** (Allow HTTP traffic).
    2. **D TCP 22** (Drop SSH traffic).
    3. **A UDP 53** (Allow DNS traffic).
    4. **A TCP 21** (Allow FTP traffic).
- Incoming packet: **UDP 53**
    
    - The packet is checked against each rule in sequence.
    - It matches the 3rd rule (**A UDP 53**) and is **allowed**.
    - Subsequent rules (e.g., rule 4) are **ignored**.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Importance of Rule Positioning**

- Incorrect Rule Order:
    
    - **D TCP**
    - **A HTTP 80**
- Incoming packet: **HTTP 80**
    
    - The packet is dropped by the first rule (**D TCP**) without checking subsequent rules.
- Correct Rule Order:
    
    - **A HTTP 80**
    - **D TCP**
    - The packet is allowed as the first rule matches.

---

#### **Scenario 3: Default Policy Behavior**

- If no rules are matched or no rules are written in a chain:
    - The chain’s **default policy** (Accept or Drop) is applied.
