### **NFQueue**:

NFQueue is a feature of Linux's Netfilter framework that allows packets to move from the kernel to user space. This lets applications like Suricata inspect and modify packets. If NFQueue support is missing, Suricata can't interact with iptables to inspect and block packets, so you won’t be able to proceed further.

### **Lab Setup**:

- **Debian 1**: Suricata configured with iptables.
- **Debian 2**: Used to ping Debian 1.

---

### **Pre-requisite**:

- Suricata must be configured on your system.

---

### **Steps to Set Up Suricata with NFQueue**:

#### **1. Check if Suricata has NFQueue support**:

Run this command to verify:

```bash
suricata --build-info | grep NFQueue
```

You should see:

```plaintext
NFQueue support: yes
```

If it doesn’t show this, do not proceed.

#### **2. Edit Suricata's `.yaml` configuration file**:

Open Suricata's configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

Search for `nfq:` and make the following changes:

```plaintext
mode: accept
repeat-mark: 1
repeat-mask: 1
route-queue: 2
```

Uncomment these lines.

#### **3. Install iptables**:

Check if iptables is installed:

```bash
sudo which iptables
```

If not, install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables -y
```

Then add the following rules:

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p icmp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 2
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p icmp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 2
```

- `-I`: Insert the rule.
- `-p`: Specifies the protocol (ICMP in this case).
- `-j`: Jumps to queue 2.

#### **4. Add a rule in `local.rules`**:

Edit Suricata’s local rules file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

Add the following rule to block ICMP:

```plaintext
drop icmp any any -> any any (msg: "Kuch Bhi Block ICMP"; sid: 123; rev: 1;)
```

#### **5. Stop Suricata**:

Stop Suricata to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop suricata
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

#### **6. Run Suricata in IPS Mode**:

Run Suricata to listen on queue 2:

```bash
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -q 2
```

#### **7. Test with a Ping from the Second Machine**:

On Debian 2, ping Debian 1:

```bash
ping <deb1_ip>
```

#### **8. Check Suricata Logs**:

Check Suricata logs to see the blocked ICMP packet:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

You should see the packet was sent to Debian 1 but was blocked, with the message "Kuch Bhi Block ICMP".
