## **Intrusion**

An intrusion is an unauthorized attempt to access, manipulate, or disable a computer system or network. IDS helps to monitor and detect such activities.

## **Types of IDS**

### **Based on Behavior**

1. **Passive IDS**:
    
    - Monitors network traffic and logs data.
        
    - Example: Snort (logs traffic without taking direct actions).
        
2. **Active IDS (IPS - Intrusion Prevention System)**:
    
    - Detects intrusions and prevents unauthorized access.
        
    - Takes actions such as stopping the traffic or alerting administrators.
        

### **Based on Installation**

1. **Host-based IDS (HIDS)**:
    
    - Monitors activities on a specific host (e.g., file changes, system logs).
        
2. **Network-based IDS (NIDS)**:
    
    - Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities.
        
3. **Hybrid IDS**:
    
    - Combines features of HIDS and NIDS.

## **Analysis Scheme**

1. **Preprocessing**:
    
    - Breaks packets into smaller pieces for easier processing.
        
2. **Analysis**:
    
    - Inspects packets based on predefined rules.
        
3. **Response**:
    
    - Takes appropriate actions based on the analysis (e.g., logging, alerting).
        
4. **Refinement**:
    
    - Adjusts IDS configurations to improve its effectiveness.

## **Intrusion Detection Methodologies**

1. **Signature-based Detection**:
    
    - Uses predefined rules or signatures to detect intrusions.
        
    - Example: `local.rules` in Snort.
        
2. **Misuse Detection**:
    
    - Identifies known attack patterns.
        
    - Example: `fail2ban` monitors for repeated login failures.
        
3. **Machine Learning-Based Detection**:
    
    - Utilizes machine learning models to identify anomalies or new attack patterns.

## **IDS Architecture**

1. **Single-tiered Architecture**:
    
    - Single-layer IDS setup.
        
    - Example: Snort Lab.
        
2. **Multi-tiered Architecture**:
    
    - Contains three components:
        
        - **Sensors**: Collect data.
            
        - **Analyzer**: Processes data.
            
        - **Manager**: Centralized control and alerting.
            
    - Centralized communication ensures all systems are informed.
        
3. **Peer-to-peer Architecture**:
    
    - Decentralized architecture where components communicate directly with each other.

## **IDS Evasion Techniques (Bypassing an IDS)**

1. **Payload Obfuscation**:
    
    - Encodes payload to make it difficult for IDS to interpret.
        
2. **Fragmentation**:
    
    - Splits payload into smaller packets to bypass detection.
        
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
    
    - Overloads the IDS with excessive traffic to make it ineffective.

## **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Types**

1. **Host-based IPS (HIPS)**:
    
    - Protects individual hosts by monitoring and controlling activities.
        
2. **Wireless IPS (WIPS)**:
    
    - Monitors and prevents attacks on wireless networks.
        
3. **Network-based IPS (NIPS)**:
    
    - Monitors network traffic to prevent intrusions.
