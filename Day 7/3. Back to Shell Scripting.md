### **Positional Parameters**

Positional parameters are arguments passed to a script from the command line when you execute it. They allow you to pass data directly to the script.

**Example Command:**

`./script27.sh 10 A sunbeam 3.142`

- **`$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.**: These refer to individual positional parameters.
    - `$1` = `10`
    - `$2` = `A`
    - `$3` = `sunbeam`
    - `$4` = `3.142`
- **`$0`**: This is the name of the script itself (`/script27.sh`).
- **`$*`**: All positional parameters as a single string.
- **`$@`**: All positional parameters as individual strings.
- **`$$`**: The process ID (PID) of the current shell.
- **`$#`**: The number of positional parameters.

### **Functions:**

Functions allow you to organize and reuse code blocks inside your script. You can define a function using the `function` keyword (optional) or just parentheses `()`.

#### Example Syntax:

`function my_function() {     echo "This is a function." }`

- **Calling the function**: You simply call it by name.
- **Arguments**: Inside functions, arguments are accessed just like positional parameters, using `$1`, `$2`, etc.

**Example:**

`my_function() {     echo "First argument: $1"     echo "Second argument: $2" } my_function "Hello" "World"`

This would output:

`First argument: Hello Second argument: World`

### **Arrays**

In shell scripting, arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays are indexed starting from 0.

**Declaration:**

`declare -a arr arr=(5 3 6 8 2 1)`

- **Accessing array elements**: Use `${arr[index]}`.

    `echo ${arr[0]}   # prints first element (5)`
    
- **Printing all elements**:
    - **`${arr[*]}`**: Prints all elements as a single string.
    - **`${arr[@]}`**: Prints each element individually.
- **Number of elements**: Use `${#arr[@]}` to get the array length.

**Example:**

`echo "Elements from index 2 onwards: ${arr[*]:2}" # prints from the 3rd element onwards (6 8 2 1)`

### **Strings**

In shell scripting, strings are simple variables that hold text. You can compare and manipulate strings using operators.

#### Common Operators

- **`=`**: True if both strings are equal.
- **`!=`**: True if both strings are not equal.
- **`-n`**: True if the string is not empty.
- **`-z`**: True if the string is empty.

#### String Concatenation

You can concatenate two strings as follows:

`str1="Ojas" str2="Dudhabaware" str3=$str1$str2 echo "Concatenated String: $str3"   # Output: OjasDudhabaware`

### **`test` Command**

The **`test` command** is used to check various conditions, such as file types and numeric comparisons. It returns an exit status (`0` for success, anything else for failure).

**Example of Checking Exit Status:**

`test -f myfile.txt echo $?    # Outputs 0 if the file exists, 1 otherwise`

**Using `test` in an `if` statement:**

`if test -f "myfile.txt"; then     echo "File exists" else     echo "File does not exist" fi`

By using the `echo $?`, you can also check the exit status of previous commands to see if they were successful (`0`) or if they failed (non-zero).
