### VI Editor Overview

**VIM** stands for **VI IMproved**, an enhanced version of the **VI** text editor. It's a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) editor commonly used in Linux systems.

#### 1. Installation Commands:

- **Install VIM using `apt`**:  
    `sudo apt-get install vim`
    
- **Install VIM using `snap`**:  
    `sudo snap install vim`
    
    Both `snap` and `apt` are package managers that install various software packages on your system.
